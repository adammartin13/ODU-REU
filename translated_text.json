hiding behind civilians as the Marines used to do in Mariupol a day earlier Russian troops launched an assault on Soledar from several directions Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Valery Zaluzhny reported to the leadership about the critical situation insisted on the withdrawal of Ukrainian units from the city to avoid being surrounded At the same time information appeared in various sources about the mass desertion of Ukrainian troops in Soledar units of the Armed Forces detachments of Polish and British mercenaries suffered huge unprecedented losses and this is more important than territorial gains the strategic success of each serious military operation is measured to a greater extent by the destruction of the enemy army than square kilometers in that day when the Ukrainian army will be completely defeated Territorial control in the Svoi zone will automatically pass to the winner - the Russian Armed Forces in the meantime a special military operation is in development and the Ukrainian garrison of the neighboring city of Artemovskbakhmut - in a semicircle of encirclement which is methodically closed by the efforts of the Russian Armed Forces and PMC Wagner paradoxical musicians have become the most worthy part of the armed forces transport communications are blocked - it is almost impossible to deliver reserves or withdraw APU units to the west under the fire control of Russian artillery three kilometers south of Artemovskabakhmut fighting continues in the village of Klecheevka where the last defensive lines of the AFU are concentrated in the southern direction the Christmas breakthrough commander-in-chief valery zaluzhny suggested to the president of ukraine vladimir zelensky to leave bakhmut -

            "Text-Translated": "Ukrainian Nazism is an explosive mixture of paganism and Satanism what is the nature and appearance of modern Ukrainian Nazism and political moral testament betrayal is impossible quot under all these conditions Russia in no way dares indifferently betray the multi-million Russian population in Ukraine renounce our unity with himquot  ndash the writer emphasized this is denazification from an applied point of view denazification ndash this is when the remains of the backbone of the regiment quot azovquot hiding hiding behind hostages in the cellars of the factory quot azovstalquot  when the unfinished Nazis ask to be released to Turkey or give them a humanitarian corridor denazification ndash this is when neo-Nazis from the quot regiment azovquot rot alive in cold factory cellars and the bodies of other Nazis rot in destroyed positions those are the Nazis which once terrified the inhabitants of the southeast war with Nazism is not an abstract thing not a slogan This is what what is the Russian army doing successfully today and it seems that it was customary to exclaim from a certain audience Well what kind of Nazis are there in Ukraine  so here they are them who wear the insignia of the SS division on chevrons them who has the same ndash character at the gates of the former base quot azovquot  where our colleague is now filming a report and a set of literature is also appropriate about brave fascists heroic Bandera mussolini however today the concept of denazification extends not only to neo-Nazi units but also on most of the Ukrainian army in any case no one has seen serious differences in the Luhansk or Donetsk republics for a long time here are the trophies from the quot base azovquot  fighters of the DPR got them flag with swastika chevrons with swastikas and runes again books and CDs about Hitler and Bandera but basically all these paraphernalia can be found in almost any unit of the army It's clear that not in a year or two not even in eight post-Maidan years Ukraine was saturated with Nazi ideology it started Certainly back in x when the USSR collapsed and Ukraine gained independence the new state urgently needed some kind of national idea I had to explain why yesterday's ideological it would seem communists have now become national leaders in the Ukrainian version the idea sounded extremely simple we ndash this is not russia Russia is also to blame for all the troubles and problems of Ukraine from the first days of independence ideology was built on the foundation of Ukrainian Nazism otherwise it would have been impossible to break traditional ties with Russia not tear Ukraine away from Russian civilization and culture by and large came from the CPSU and acted like the Bolsheviks and ndash when the Soviet man was created Ukrainian authorities ndash Svidomo Gromodyanin perfect Ukrainian and the basis for this was schoolchildren and students the books of the fathers of Ukrainian nationalism were printed in thousands of copies at my house under Yushchenko under Yanukovych whether in Russian in Ukrainian Bandera and Bandera gradually became heroes Ukrainian diasporas from Canada and the USA took an active part in this it\u2019s as if in Russia the former Vlasovites and policemen were responsible for the education of youth and ideology to be fair to say that we almost fell into it hold out but Ukraine is not Besides there was another reason why Nazi ideas became more popular year by year how strange but first of all not even in the west of Ukraine and in the south and southeast deindustrialization x and zero plant ndash open back in tsarist or soviet times ndash closed fathers lost their jobs children were easy to explain that Muscovites are to blame for everything and that's why in Russian it seems Kharkov was the most powerful structure quot right sectorquot banned in Russia and in Dnepropetrovsk they formed quot azovquot  By the way kgo leader andrey beletsky graduated from kharkov university dedicated his thesis for a year to the history of the Ukrainian insurgent army banned in the Russian Federation that is Bandera militants this is how ideas were gradually legalized and introduced to the masses in general in Ukraine ten years ago it was considered normal to approve of Nazism and just joke around with it just an example Friday with quot azovstaliquot the family came out civil hostages began to check ndash and here is the father of the family ordinary worker I took a photo with an iron cross with a Nazi salute checked ndash No still not a fighter quot azovquot  I took the photo stupidly but the atmosphere is political what a photo with an iron cross ndash This is fine and in general Bandera ndash hero Bandera ndash freedom fighters Wehrmacht ndash liberators that's how they talked about everything undoubtedly for all the far right neo-Nazi neo-Bandera parties and movements were serious people top politicians big oligarchs the Nazis were their resource and combat unit on the Maidan it was they who were the striking force and then it was from them and the football fans who joined the neo-Nazis that the first territorial battalions were formed easier punishers neo-nazis ideological romanticism of the Maidan marginal adventurers just bandits ndash hellish brew Melting Pot from which the most fierce came out the most brutal national battalions quot Dniproquot  quot tornadoquot  quot headingquot  quot azovquot  but all the same the Nazi idea was the unifying idea for them idea of \u200b\u200bracial superiority and Ukrainians over Russians and right Ukrainians that eats nationalists over wrong how once the SS in Germany was created on the principle of a kind of knightly order so and quot azovquot  and others have copied this scheme Nazis ndash like knights of racial struggle that carry the light of national consciousness and you can carry it as you like ndash even torture even by murder important matter this situation attracted to the punitive battalions a lot of those who simply could not realize themselves in life or people with a low level of education lowered moral threshold lazy and slackers in the end and so came to quot azovquot ndash and you are no longer anyone \u0430 quot warrior of lightquot  with a swastika stuffed all over the back and everything is possible torture kill what exactly were neo-Nazis here is an example militantnazi captured tattoos Mauthausen concentration camp for life ss soldiers Nazi iron cross rune odal ndash badge of employees of the SS headquarters for race issues now imagine what are these ndash hundreds and all with weapons and are considered an official military unit a large number of nationalists having passed the run-in in punitive battalions went to the army bringing their ideology there and tacklet but the army is everywhere too gotta understand it not in the barracks take the shelling of Luhansk and Donetsk What the military did not understand where they shoot understood but they were told that the wrong people are sitting there Muscovites and separatists who don't mind killing because only they prevent Ukraine from living and it's all about knowledge received at the school desk  "

            "Text": "mad max reality: kievs blast of kakhovka dam has new hidden nuclear risks the kakhovka dam damage is fraught with nuclear risks which have so far remained neglected both by the kiev regime and the west, dr. christopher busby, physical chemist and scientific secretary of the european committee on radiation risk, told sputnik. t: t: t: analysis nikolai patrushev volodymyr zelensky kiev zaporozhye ukraine sputnik russian ministry of defense chernobyl the kiev regime attacked and damaged the dam of the kakhovka hydroelectric power plant hpp on june , leading to the destruction of its upper part and the uncontrollable release of a huge amount of water down the dnepr river. however, the sabotage has posed risks upstream, too, given that water from the kakhovka reservoir is used to cool the zaporozhye nuclear power plants npp six reactors and spent fuel storage. international atomic energy agency iaea head rafael grossi has recently warned that the dams water levels are reportedly continuing to fall in the reservoir, causing a possible difference of about two meters. per grossi, the height of the water is crucial for the continued operability of the water pumps used for the npp cooling.however, it is not the only risk related to the regions nuclear facilities, according to busby. he noted that the partial damage to the kakhovka dam causes flooding downstream and exposes sediment upstream. the physical chemist warned that apart from all the oils, chemicals, dead animals, sewage, and other dangerous stuff ending up on land when the floodwaters recede, there is a missing and invisible hazard: radiation.but that is not all, per busby: the river bed of dnepr could still potentially contain radionuclide elements from the chernobyl disaster of . these elements remain radioactive for a time period defined by the concept of halflife which is the time that it takes for half of the radioactivity to disappear as the radionuclide decays into a different element, giving off radiation in the process, the scientist explained.busby appears to be deeply concerned about the seemingly lax attitude to the nuclear contamination issue demonstrated by both the kiev regime and the west. in his previous interviews with sputnik, busby raised the alarm over londons decision to arm the kiev regime with depleted uranium ammunition and a subsequent huge explosion in the western ukrainian town of khmelnitsky in may resulting in nothing short of a radioactive cloud. per russian security council secretary nikolay patrushev, the ukrainian forces secretly stored the ukprovided depleted uranium ammo in the town. in may, the veteran chemical physicist lambasted the ukrainian authorities over the continuous shelling of the zaporozhye npp, conducted by the ukrainian armed forces and nationalist battalions on a regular basis since the time the npp came under russias control.the kiev regimes nuclear adventurism does not end here: the russian ministry of defense has repeatedly warned about a potential ukrainian false flag operation involving a dirty bomb, i.e. an explosive device loaded with radioactive materials. the western mainstream press has been routinely downplaying or neglecting the issue, as well as kievs apparent prowess to create atomic weapons and ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskys remark about dropping the nonnuclear status made at the munich security conference on february , . on top of that, the ukrainian press has openly discussed kievs options to create nuclear arms in fiveseven years, or even

given that water from the kakhovka reservoir is used to cool the zaporozhye nuclear power plants npp six reactors and spent fuel storage. international atomic energy agency iaea head rafael grossi has recently warned that the dams water levels are reportedly continuing to fall in the reservoir, causing a possible difference of about two meters. per grossi, the height of the water is crucial for the continued operability of the water pumps used for the npp cooling. i warned in an earlier article about the dangers of loss of cooling water if the dam on the lake was destroyed to the extent of draining the lake, dr. christopher busby told sputnik. the dam has now been destroyed. the question now is how far will the water level fall, and where is the cooling intake pipe relative to the depth

dead animals, sewage, and other dangerous stuff ending up on land when the floodwaters recede, there is a missing and invisible hazard: radiation. nuclear power makes large quantities of radioactive substances which are produced when the uranium atoms are split to provide the energy. the zaporozhye nuclear power station, which is cooled from the lake, also discharges radioactivity routinely and this stuff ends up in the lake where it is mostly trapped in the sediment at the bottom of the lake. when the dam bursts, this material, or some of it, will end up in the floodwater to be left behind on the shores and in the houses as the water recedes. it is invisible and can only be detected with a geiger counter, or some other sophisticated device. world znpp still able to pump water from

off radiation in the process, the scientist explained. strontiumand cesiumhave halflives of aboutyears, busby said. since the chernobyl disaster was in , almost half of the releases into the water table draining to the dnepr is still there. for the plutonium and uranium particles, the halflives are so great that it can be assumed they are all there. when the floods recede, there will be this chernobyl radioactivity exposed as sediment dust in houses and on the ground. upstream the sediment is exposed also. this is a radiation hazard. when dried out, the radioactive dust is resuspended and

            "Text": "ukraines depleted uranium blast: europe on brink of environmental disaster russian security council secretary nikolai patrushev warned on friday that a radioactive cloud was heading towards western europe following the destruction of a ukrainian warehouse storing britishsupplied depleted uranium ammo. t: t: t: analysis russia ukraine depleted uranium radioactivity radioactive radioactive material ukrainian crisis sputnik news spoke with dr. chris busby, physical chemist and scientific secretary of the european committee on radiation risk, about how the west\u2019s decision to provide depleted uranium du ammunition to ukraine has potentially caused a continentwide ecological disaster. below is his answer in full.recently, several web media outlets provided videos of an enormous explosion in the town of khmelnitski, located to the west of kiev, and aboutkm from the border with poland. there were two major explosions which produced a massive roiling swirling fireball which, like an atomic bomb, developed upwards and formed a mushroom cloud, which was black.i have represented nuclear atmospheric test veterans in the royal courts of justice in london and have seen many films of nuclear explosions: this was not one. a nuclear explosion is characterised by an immediate intense white light which wipes out the camera film or detector.so, what was it? it was suggested by several commentators that an arms depot that had been hit contained the depleted uranium du weapons sent by the uk to the ukraine for use in the british challenger tanks as antitank penetrators. that the explosion was one involving the burning of the du in the fireball. since i am a scientific authority on uranium and its health effects, but have also examined its dispersion and behaviour in the environment, i will comment on what i believe happened, and why it is important. i was a member of the uk government ministry of defence depleted uranium oversight boardduob in , and also the uk government committee examining radiation risk from internal emitters cerrie . i am scientific secretary of the european committee on radiation risk ecrr which is an independent ngo that provides advice on risk from ionising radiation.my main research interest in this area is uranium and health, particularly the du particles, which are so small they act as a gas and move over very large distances once they are created by the burning of du. i found them in england inafter they had come from iraq. i found them inin england after they came from the ukraine war. so that is the first thing: the material is able to travel very large distances.therefore, if the khmelnitsky explosion was a du one, the material would move with the wind direction and should be detectable at monitor sites downwind.first, we need to say that du has a gamma signature, it releases gamma rays. the uk and usa governments lie about this. they point to the fact that the u, that remains after the fissile u is removed in the centrifuges and is sent off for nuclear weapons and reactors, is a weak alpha emitter.they say that alpha radiation cannot penetrate skin and so the du itself is harmless. that it cannot be detected by a geiger counter and the alpha particles don\u2019t make it through the window. there is, of course, a health problem if the postimpact particles are inhaled and pass into the body through the lung into the lymphatic system or directly into the digestive system, but essentially du is harmless.what you need to know is that uranium , when it decays with its alpha emission, turns into thorium and protoactiniumm which then turns into uranium . thoriumis a beta and gamma emitter deliveringof its decay energy as a gamma ray. thus, large clouds of du particulate aerosol will be detectable by gamma detectors.when i visited iraq with al jazeera ini went to the south and examined the corpses of the tanks that had been hit by du in the first gulf war. some of the a du penetrators were still lying around. they gave off an intense gamma ray signal, and the holes in the tanks were highly gamma ray active. so much for only an alpha emitter.i am a yachtsman: examination of the uk metereological weather pressure maps tell us that at the time, and for days after the explosion, there was an anticyclone to the north of the explosion site and winds were weak but from the south east blowing north westerly around the highpressure area. so, the plume would move towards poland. if the winds were about kmh they would reach any poland detectorskm away on the th.after chernobyl, the european union set up a europewide gamma radiation detector system that used to give gamma readings in real time. i went to look. but astonishingly, all the data was blocked. the web based system, administered from germany, eurdep would not provide the detector maps that are normally available. luckily, there were some location maps on the web and some that had been already downloaded by colleagues of mine before the system stopped working. i obtained maps from poland. one of these i show below.you will see that a very highly significant increase in gamma radiation occurred at this detector, north west of the explosion site almost exactly when it would be expected on the basis of a distance of km and a mean wind speed of kmh. the increase, from nsvh to nsvh was highly statistically significant about . other detectors all across poland showed an increase, as the plume passed over them, the increase being weaker the further away due to dispersion of the plume.later, the poles measured the increase at the marie curie institute in lublin, but their map was a more sophisticated one and needed some expert interpretation. the polish map gave gamma increases split into two natural isotopes, bismuth and thallium, also total gamma and cosmic ray gamma.from the map, we are to assume and this was the implicit message that the gamma peak was due to bismuth. enter sherlock holmes. bismuthis a radon daughter. the natural background radioactive gas radon rn is always present, since it is produced from uranium and radium in the ground. if there is a sudden change in atmospheric pressure, or when it rains, there is a gamma peak from radon, which shows itself as the bi peak. so, the poles seem to be implying that the increase in gamma radiation is normal and nothing to get scared about. many have picked up on the bismuth spectrum. but the way in which the polish graphs are presented is misleading.the problem with a radon argument is first that the gamma increases go up all across poland at a time scale that identifies a plume from khmelnitsky and second that there was a stable anticyclone weather system and no atmospheric pressure changes that might pull radon out of the ground. i checked all that. there was only some light rain over lublin.there is, however, an additional possibility. very fine particles attract radon: you get a slight increase in gamma from radon near factory chimneys that emit fine particles.the european radiation detector system web map came back online on may . the map type had been changed and everything we saw in the downloads had disappeared or had been smudged out by data analysis averaging. why? this, and the early blocking of access to the site suggest panic and coverup.so taken all together, what we see is a massive explosion which is thought to be du, and reports of a spike in gamma radiation near the site. uranium oxide is black, and the black plume moves north west slowly, the weather pattern is stable and the wind blows to poland. the polish eu detectors all show gamma radiation increases at the expected time of arrival of the plume. the eu detector system is shut down rapidly, but not before we have obtained data from several sites. the poles provide a detector result that identified bismuth as the cause of the increase, but do not go so far as to formally state that it is

damage and death like that seen in the balkans and iraq. cancer, birth defects, miscarriage, infertility, lung damage, mental problems gulf war syndrome and so forth. the scientific and epidemiological evidence on this has been clear since the gulf war. it is all there in the scientific literature\u2014but the governments in the west and the military ignore it, deny it and cover it up. in the case of the uk coroners court finding for stuart dyson, the jury found that du caused his fatal colon cancer. but when the coroner wrote to the health minister as he had to by uk law, rulethe reply was: we disagree. this stuff can be measured, but no one will measure it, or if they do, they will be attacked and their arguments dismissed.even if i am wrong, and there is some other explanation for the gamma peaks, du must be banned. it is a weapon of indiscriminate effect and kills civilians, the enemy and your own troops well, ukrainian troops. it is much worse than a war gas,

            "Text-Translated": "ukraines depleted uranium blast europe on brink of environmental disaster russian security council secretary nikolai patrushev warned on friday that a radioactive cloud was heading towards western europe following the destruction of a ukrainian warehouse storing britishsupplied depleted uranium ammo t t t analysis russia ukraine depleted uranium radioactivity radioactive radioactive material ukrainian crisis sputnik news spoke with dr chris busby physical chemist and scientific secretary of the european committee on radiation risk about how the west\u2019s decision to provide depleted uranium du ammunition to ukraine has potentially caused a continentwide ecological disaster below is his answer in full recently several web media outlets provided videos of an enormous explosion in the town of khmelnitski located to the west of kiev and aboutkm from the border with poland there were two major explosions which produced a massive roiling swirling fireball which like an atomic bomb developed upwards and formed a mushroom cloud which was black i have represented nuclear atmospheric test veterans in the royal courts of justice in london and have seen many films of nuclear explosions this was not one a nuclear explosion is characterised by an immediate intense white light which wipes out the camera film or detector so what was it it was suggested by several commentators that an arms depot that had been hit contained the depleted uranium du weapons sent by the uk to the ukraine for use in the british challenger tanks as antitank penetrators that the explosion was one involving the burning of the du in the fireball since i am a scientific authority on uranium and its health effects but have also examined its dispersion and behaviour in the environment i will comment on what i believe happened and why it is important i was a member of the uk government ministry of defence depleted uranium oversight boardduob in and also the uk government committee examining radiation risk from internal emitters cerrie i am scientific secretary of the european committee on radiation risk ecrr which is an independent ngo that provides advice on risk from ionising radiation my main research interest in this area is uranium and health particularly the du particles which are so small they act as a gas and move over very large distances once they are created by the burning of du i found them in england inafter they had come from iraq i found them inin england after they came from the ukraine war so that is the first thing the material is able to travel very large distances therefore if the khmelnitsky explosion was a du one the material would move with the wind direction and should be detectable at monitor sites downwind first we need to say that du has a gamma signature it releases gamma rays the uk and usa governments lie about this they point to the fact that the u that remains after the fissile u is removed in the centrifuges and is sent off for nuclear weapons and reactors is a weak alpha emitter they say that alpha radiation cannot penetrate skin and so the du itself is harmless that it cannot be detected by a geiger counter and the alpha particles don\u2019t make it through the window there is of course a health problem if the postimpact particles are inhaled and pass into the body through the lung into the lymphatic system or directly into the digestive system but essentially du is harmless what you need to know is that uranium when it decays with its alpha emission turns into thorium and protoactiniumm which then turns into uranium thoriumis a beta and gamma emitter deliveringof its decay energy as a gamma ray thus large clouds of du particulate aerosol will be detectable by gamma detectors when i visited iraq with al jazeera ini went to the south and examined the corpses of the tanks that had been hit by du in the first gulf war some of the a du penetrators were still lying around they gave off an intense gamma ray signal and the holes in the tanks were highly gamma ray active so much for only an alpha emitter i am a yachtsman examination of the uk metereological weather pressure maps tell us that at the time and for days after the explosion there was an anticyclone to the north of the explosion site and winds were weak but from the south east blowing north westerly around the highpressure area so the plume would move towards poland if the winds were about kmh they would reach any poland detectorskm away on the th after chernobyl the european union set up a europewide gamma radiation detector system that used to give gamma readings in real time i went to look but astonishingly all the data was blocked the web based system administered from germany eurdep would not provide the detector maps that are normally available luckily there were some location maps on the web and some that had been already downloaded by colleagues of mine before the system stopped working i obtained maps from poland one of these i show below you will see that a very highly significant increase in gamma radiation occurred at this detector north west of the explosion site almost exactly when it would be expected on the basis of a distance of km and a mean wind speed of kmh the increase from nsvh to nsvh was highly statistically significant about other detectors all across poland showed an increase as the plume passed over them the increase being weaker the further away due to dispersion of the plume later the poles measured the increase at the marie curie institute in lublin but their map was a more sophisticated one and needed some expert interpretation the polish map gave gamma increases split into two natural isotopes bismuth and thallium also total gamma and cosmic ray gamma from the map we are to assume and this was the implicit message that the gamma peak was due to bismuth enter sherlock holmes bismuthis a radon daughter the natural background radioactive gas radon rn is always present since it is produced from uranium and radium in the ground if there is a sudden change in atmospheric pressure or when it rains there is a gamma peak from radon which shows itself as the bi peak so the poles seem to be implying that the increase in gamma radiation is normal and nothing to get scared about many have picked up on the bismuth spectrum but the way in which the polish graphs are presented is misleading the problem with a radon argument is first that the gamma increases go up all across poland at a time scale that identifies a plume from khmelnitsky and second that there was a stable anticyclone weather system and no atmospheric pressure changes that might pull radon out of the ground i checked all that there was only some light rain over lublin there is however an additional possibility very fine particles attract radon you get a slight increase in gamma from radon near factory chimneys that emit fine particles the european radiation detector system web map came back online on may the map type had been changed and everything we saw in the downloads had disappeared or had been smudged out by data analysis averaging why this and the early blocking of access to the site suggest panic and coverup so taken all together what we see is a massive explosion which is thought to be du and reports of a spike in gamma radiation near the site uranium oxide is black and the black plume moves north west slowly the weather pattern is stable and the wind blows to poland the polish eu detectors all show gamma radiation increases at the expected time of arrival of the plume the eu detector system is shut down rapidly but not before we have obtained data from several sites the poles provide a detector result that identified bismuth as the cause of the increase but do not go so far as to formally state that it is in case of later blowback one final piece of evidence we see videos on the internet of the ukrainians clearing up the explosion site using robot vehicles not ordinary firemen why do they need robot vehicles the last times we saw robot vehicles clearing up was in the ruins of chernobyl and fukushima if i am right there has been an environmental disaster and the du particles will travel across poland germany and hungary and will end up in the baltics probably later the whole of europe

which means no one was ever going to establish peace in ukraine. so, russia was deceived. but what was the purpose? to protect ukraine or to invade it themselves? why did they need this deception if they could simply implement what was recommended by germany? or did germany deliberately recommend something that could never be implemented? we could go as far as asking if political swindlers could be drawn to accountability, but it seems much more relevant today to start clearing the smoke around the current situation. that is how it has played out, anyway. but what were the root causes? and how can we get out of this situation, that is getting ever more dangerous? so let us begin our analysis by looking at the origins.what was the outcome of the cold war?the beginning of a new war usually finds its origin in the end of a previous one. the ukraine conflict was preceded by the cold war. the answer to the question about its outcome will bring us closer to understanding of the essence of the current conflict, one which extends beyond ukraine and affects many countries. the thing is that western countries and the countries of the postsoviet space, primarily russia, have different perceptions of the outcome of this conflict.the west definitely considers itself as a winner and russia as a defeated party. since, in their eyes, russia was defeated, then the territories of the former ussr and the eastern bloc are the legitimate prey of the us and nato and are subject to control by the west under the motto \u201cwoe to the conquered!\u201d hence ukraine is in the zone of influence of the us and nato, and certainly not russia. so, any of russia\u2019s claims to at least any influence on ukrainian politics and protection of its interests in the region are \u201cgroundless\u201d and a clear infringement on the interests of the us and nato. \u201cwe no longer have to view the world through a prism of eastwest relations. the cold war is over\u201d \u2013 declared margaret thatcher in the early s. it means the position of the east, of russia, is no longer relevant. there is one vector, one master of the universe, one winner.russia has a completely different view of this process. in no way does it consider itself as a defeated party. the end of the cold war was brought about by democratic reforms of political and economic life, and military confrontation was replaced by trade and integration with the west. so, if one\u2019s former foe becomes a friend today, is it not a victory? besides, the ussr and then the russian federation never had the goal of winning the cold war but rather exiting the military confrontation between east and west that could have ended with a nuclear catastrophe. moscow, together with washington, found this way out, having reached the goals not so much for themselves as for the whole world.this way out by no means implied that the west would take over the east and subordinate the postsoviet space in economic, legal and cultural respects. quite the contrary: it implied equal cooperation and joint work to build a new political and economic reality. so, there are clearly two different attitudes to the outcome of the cold war: the triumph of the winners, on the one part, and building a new world and a new civilization, on the other. the difference between these two attitudes would predetermine the developments that followed.new world or new western colonies?inthe soviet union collapsed, but inthe european union was established \u2013 something the postsoviet space including russia associated big hopes with. here, at last, there seemed to be a new world, a new supranational body, a new turn in the history of western civilization. russia, just like other states of the former eastern bloc and the ussr, saw itself in the future as an equal member of this union. the vision of \u201ceurope from lisbon to vladivostok\u201d was born.in this context, russia welcomed not only the reunification of germany but also the accession of its former allies and even former soviet republics to the eu. in the s, economic integration with the west was a priority for russia; moscow considered it as key to its success as a modern state. the russian leadership had no particular desire to bind to itself the former soviet republics, including ukraine. most of the soviet republics had lived off subsidies from the central government, in other words, russia. so, the leaders of these countries were given a friendly pat on the shoulder while moscow sought to get rid of their economic burden as soon as possible.faster than ukraine, russia began to integrate into the european market. russia had vast volumes of energy resources that are in demand in europe, while ukraine, on the contrary, couldn\u2019t afford to buy energy resources at european prices. ukrainian independence could well have ended with an economic meltdown but for the southeast, where heavy fighting is going on right now. with its vast production facilities and advanced industry, the southeast helped ukraine find its place in the international division of labor. one would not normally mention this fact, but in the s it was the russianspeaking southeast that saved the economic and hence political independence of ukraine.now let us turn to something different. since the s, a series of major ethnic conflicts and wars involving millions of people emerged in europe and close to its borders. until , there had not been such a big number of ethnic clashes. all of this led to the breakup of yugoslavia and loss by georgia, moldova and syria of their territorial integrity. this does not make any sense if we look at it from the perspective of european integration. the goal of this union was not the fragmentation of europe into a multitude of small states, but quite the contrary: the creation of a huge supranational union of nations, and these nations would not have to exterminate each other, nor to multiply the borders, but rather build a new world together. so, what was wrong here?it only seems wrong if one relies on the concept that russia used to stick to. and if one proceeds from the concept of the victory of the west in the cold war, then ethnic conflicts acquire a completely different meaning. the latter was articulated on numerous occasions, e.g., at the meeting of the joint chiefs of staff on october , , when us president bill clinton said: \u201cusing the blunders of soviet diplomacy, the extreme arrogance of gorbachev and his entourage, including those who openly took a proamerican position, we achieved what president truman was going to do with the soviet union through the atomic bomb.\u201dit suggests that far from all western politicians wanted to build a new and just world. their goal was to defeat the adversary \u2013 the ussr, yugoslavia and other states. in this sense, the escalation of interethnic conflicts seems only logical, as they weaken the adversary and in the case of a victory, they help to dismember the country to make it easier for the winner to take over.under these circumstances, the real state of affairs does not play any role. the situation is being deliberately escalated. on the one hand, representatives of the titular nation are being declared as organizers of the genocide, annihilating the foreign language and culture and performing ethnic cleansing. on the other hand, representatives of the national minority living in communities in certain parts of the country are being declared separatists and a threat to the state. this tactic dates back to ancient times and was used by the roman empire. but the building of a new slaveholding empire is not something we are witnessing these days, is it? or probably washington, for example, does consider the postsoviet space as some provinces of a greater empire that already have their metropole and should be protected from barbarians who do not want to be under the control of this empire?so, there are two political strategies: the economic and political integration of the countries with mutual benefit at the cornerstone, and the takeover of some countries by the others, with zero respect for the interests of the states that are being taken over. such countries can be dismembered, declared rogue states or conquered.let us elaborate on this in more detail. russia has taken western democracy as a model, carried out reforms and begun to integrate into the western world. from the point of view of building a common european house, this should be welcomed and encouraged. europe gets a peaceful and economically reliable partner along with its markets and resources, which certainly makes it even stronger. but if one is guided by colonial thinking, one would not tolerate the economic growth and independence of a distant colony. provinces should not overtake the metropole, neither financially, nor politically, nor culturally.there is the eu that was engaged in building a new economic reality. and there is the nato established inthat confronted the east, primarily the ussr and later russia. remember the words by the first secretarygeneral of the nato hastings ismay: the bloc was intended \u201cto keep the americans in, the russians out and the germans down.\u201d thus, the nato ideology implies that the us is in europe, and in a dominating position, and russia is not.but how should russia take it? it ended the cold war in good faith, while it seems that the us and the nato have not. which means that unification with the west intended for russia will not happen on equal terms, but rather take the form of an economic and political takeover. hence moscow\u2019s requirement to stop the enlargement towards russia\u2019s borders and revise the attitudes and the agreements. what we see now is that the nato concept has not only derailed russia\u2019s integration into europe but closed the door to europe\u2019s expansion and development. of the two concepts mentioned in this article, one has clearly defeated the other.russia and ukraine \u2013 the tragedy of relationshipslet us move on from the general picture directly to relations between russia and ukraine. let us start from the fact that the relations between these countries have their own specific history. these relationships are closer than the collaboration between england and scotland, or the northern and southern states of the us. ukraine was part of russia for more than three hundred years, which influenced its culture, ethnic composition and mentality. ukraine\u2019s independence inwas gained through an agreement with moscow, not as a result of a national struggle for liberation. the new economic and political reality prompted the russian elite not only to grant independence to ukraine, but also to push for it. at that time, no one could have imagined an armed clash between the two new states, even in a nightmare. the ukrainians saw russia as a friendly state, and the russians as a fraternal nation, and these sentiments were shared by russians.in russia, for a long time, the concept of \u201canother russia\u201d prevailed with respect to ukraine, which supposes much closer relations than, for example, those between britain and canada. there was a popular saying in everyday life: we have one people, but different states. ukrainians and russians were very interested in the political life of their respective neighbors. a suitable example is the current president of ukraine zelensky, who made a living from political satire, usually based on the politics of both states.however, the example of ukraine clearly demonstrates how the concept of creating a common political and economic space was defeated by the concept of squeezing russia out of europe. in the wake of the first \u2018maidan\u2019 color revolution in , ukraine started building antirussian policy at the level of state ideology. in this, one can see clearly that this policy follows the templates of the cold war. that is, psychologically, the ukrainians were turned against the russians through the support of certain politicians, changes in the educational system, in culture and in national media broadcasting. all of this came under the guise of democratic reforms and positive changes supported by all sorts of western and international organizations.within ukraine itself, two countries had existed since : antirussia, and ukraine as another russia. while one does not think itself without russia, the other does not think of itself with russia. however, this division is quite artificial. ukraine has spent most of its history with russia, and it is tied to it culturally and mentally.ukraine\u2019s integration with russia is definitely dictated by the economy. after all, if there is such a huge market and resources nearby, only a very shallow power could not use it, or go so far as to block it. antirussian sentiments have brought ukraine nothing but grief and poverty. therefore, all prowestern nationalist movements consciously or unconsciously preach poverty and destitution to the ukrainian people.we have already mentioned that it was the southeast with its production potential that helped the country find its footing in the international division of labor. it turned out that most of the money was earned by the east, a large russianspeaking region. naturally, this could not but effect its political representation in the ukrainian government. the southeast had more human resources and financial tools, which did not fit into the prowestern picture of ukraine. the people who lived there were too proud, too free, and too rich.both the first and second maidans were directed against viktor yanukovych, the former governor of donetsk, the leader of donbass and nonnationalist centrist political forces. electoral support for such forces was very significant, and ukraine did not want to be \u2018antirussia\u2019 for a very long time. president yushchenko, who arrived with the first maidan, very quickly lost the confidence of the people, for the most part because of his antirussian policies.then an interesting trend emerged in ukrainian politics. the elections after the second maidan are won by president poroshenko, who promised peace with russia in one week. so, he was elected as a peacemaker president. nevertheless, he became the president of the war, failed to implement the minsk agreements, and miserably lost the following election. he was replaced by vladimir zelensky, who also promised peace, but became the personification of war. so, the ukrainian people are promised peace and then they are deceived. having gained power under the rhetoric of peacemaking, he becomes the second ukrainian leader to have taken an extremely radical position. if he had such a position at the beginning of the election campaign, no one would have elected him.and now let us return to the general concept of this article. if one says that one is going to build a new world with the neighbors but simply pushes one\u2019s own interests, regardless of anything, even war, even the threat of nuclear conflict, then obviously one is not going to build anything. this is what the expresident of ukraine poroshenko did and this is what the current president zelensky is doing, but not only them. this is what the nato leadership and many american and european politicians are doing.before the armed conflict, zelensky simply crushed any opposition, pushing through the interests of his party; he did not build any peace. in ukraine, politicians, journalists, and public activists who spoke about peace and goodneighborly relations with russia were repressed before the military clash, their media were closed without any legal grounds, and their property was plundered. when the ukrainian authorities were reproached for violating the rule of law and freedom of speech, the answer was that the peace party was a bunch of traitors and propagandists. and the democratic west was satisfied with this answer.in reality, the situation was not so simple and straightforward. traitors and propagandists represented, including in the parliament, not just the lions share of the electorate, but also the basis of the countrys economic potential. so, the blow fell not only on democracy, but also on the wellbeing of the citizens. zelenskys policy has led to a situation where people began to leave ukraine en masse due to adverse economic and social conditions, repression, and political persecution. among them were a lot of ukrainian politicians, journalists, businessmen, and cultural and religious figures who had done a lot for this country. these people have been excluded from politics and public life by the ukrainian authorities, although they have the right to have their own position, no less than zelensky and his team.the business of the southeast of the country is largely tied to russia and its interests; that is why the conflict has ceased to be an exclusively internal matter. russia was faced with the need to protect not only its economic interests, but also international honor and dignity, which, as was shown above, had been systematically denied. there was no one to rectify the situation. the ukrainian peace party was declared to be treacherous and power was seized by the war party. the conflict dragged on, and took on an international dimension.it would seem that politics still mean something in europe, but the politicians massively support zelensky, dragging europe into the war and towards the bloc\u2019s economic downfall. it is no longer europe that teaches ukraine politics, but ukraine that teaches europe how to achieve economic decline and poverty with the help of a policy of hatred and intransigence. if europe continues to support this policy, it will be dragged into a war, possibly into a nuclear one.and now let us get back to where we started. the cold war ended with a political decision to build a new world with no wars. it is clear that such a world has never been built, that current global politics has returned to where it started: with detente. now there are only two ways out: to slide into a world war and a nuclear confrontation, or to restart the process of detente, for which it is necessary to take into account the interests of all parties. but for this to happen, it is necessary first to acknowledge that russia has its own interests and that they must be taken into account in the creation of a new detente. and, most importantly, to play honestly, not to deceive anyone, not to blow smoke, and not to make money on someone elses blood. but if the global political system is not capable of elementary decency; if it is blinded by pride and its own mercantile interests, then even harder times await us.the ukraine conflict will either grow further, spilling over to europe and other countries, or it will be localized and resolved. but how can it be resolved if the party of war reigns supreme in ukraine, escalating military hysteria that has already gone beyond the borders of the country, and the west for some reason stubbornly calls it democracy? this party of war has declared an infinite number of times that it does not need any peace: what it needs is more weapons and money for the war. these people have built their politics and business on the war, they have rapidly upgraded their international ratings. in europe and in the us they are greeted with applause, they should not be asked uncomfortable questions, there should be no doubt in their sincerity and truthfulness. the ukrainian party of war keeps delivering triumph after triumph, while no military breakthrough is observed.but the ukrainian party of peace is favored neither in europe nor in the us. this eloquently suggests that most us and european politicians do not want any peace for ukraine. but this does not mean at all that the ukrainians do not want peace, or that zelenskys military triumph is more important to them than their lives and destroyed homes. it is just that those who stood for peace were slandered, intimidated and repressed following the incitement of the west. the ukrainian party of peace simply did not fit into western democracy.and here the question arises: if the party of peace and civil dialogue does not fit into some kind of democracy, then is it a democracy? perhaps, in order to save their country, the ukrainians have to now start building their own democracy and open their civil dialogue without western curators, the result of their governance of which is harmful and destructive. if the west does not want to listen to the point of view of the other ukraine, then this is its own business, but for ukraine such a point of view is important and necessary, otherwise this nightmare will never end. this means that it is necessary to create a political movement composed of those who have not given up, who have not renounced their beliefs on pain of death and imprisonment, who do not want their country to become a place of geopolitical showdowns. the ukrainian situation is catastrophically complex and dangerous, but it has nothing to do with what zelensky says every day.",

teaches europe how to achieve economic decline and poverty with the help of a policy of hatred and intransigence if europe continues to support this policy it will be dragged into a war possibly into a nuclear one and now let us get back to where we started the cold war ended with a political decision to build a new world with no wars it is clear that such a world has never been built that current global politics has returned to where it started with detente now there are only two ways out to slide into a world war and a nuclear confrontation or to restart the process of detente for which it is necessary to take into account the interests of all parties but for this to happen it is necessary first to acknowledge that russia has its own interests and that they must be taken into account in the creation of a new detente and most importantly to play honestly not to deceive anyone not to blow smoke and not to make money on someone elses blood but if the global political system is not capable of elementary decency if it is blinded by pride and its own mercantile interests then even harder times await us the ukraine conflict will either grow further spilling over to europe and other countries or it will be localized and resolved but how can it be resolved if the party of war reigns supreme in ukraine escalating military hysteria that has already gone beyond the borders of the country and the west for some reason stubbornly calls it democracy this party of war has declared an infinite number of times that it does not need any peace what it needs is more weapons and money for the war these people have built their politics and business on the war they have rapidly upgraded their international ratings in europe and in the us they are greeted with applause they should not be asked uncomfortable questions there should be no doubt in their sincerity and truthfulness the ukrainian party of war keeps delivering triumph after triumph while no military breakthrough is observed but the ukrainian party of peace is favored neither in europe nor in the us this eloquently suggests that most us and european politicians do not want any peace for ukraine but this does not mean at all that the ukrainians do not want peace or that zelenskys military triumph is more important to them than their lives and destroyed homes it is just that those who stood for peace were slandered intimidated and repressed following the incitement of the west the ukrainian party of peace simply did not fit into western democracy and here the question arises if the party of peace and civil dialogue does not fit into some kind of democracy then is it a democracy perhaps in order to save their country the ukrainians have to now start building their own democracy and open their civil dialogue without western curators the result of their governance of which is harmful and destructive if the west does not want to listen to the point of view of the other ukraine then this is its own business but for ukraine such a point of view is important and necessary otherwise this nightmare will never end this means that it is necessary to create a political movement composed of those who have not given up who have not renounced their beliefs on pain of death and imprisonment who do not want their country to become a place of geopolitical showdowns the ukrainian situation is catastrophically complex and dangerous but it has nothing to do with what zelensky says every day  "

us, and more broadly east vs west.\u201dtiberio graziani, chairman of vision ;amp; global trends, a romebased geopolitical affairs think tank, expressed similar sentiments, saying that \u201cgiven the current circumstances related to the crisis between the west and the russian federation,\u201d thursday\u2019s verdict could not have been nonpolitical. \u201crussia was not allowed to participate in the trial in which it was directly accused, precisely because it was considereda priori \u2013 guilty from the outset. we recall that the tragic event was used right from the start in the context of the long hybrid war that the west has waged since at least the early years of this century. furthermore, in [this specific case, the question of the insurance companies that will have to pay the damages must also be taken into account,\u201d graziani said.\u2018farce masquerading as a trial\u2019christopher c. black, an international criminal and human rights lawyer with overyears of experience covering war crimes and international relations under his belt, provided sputnik with an indepth account of the question marks surrounding the mh saga and, like his counterparts above, characterized thursday\u2019s verdict as the \u201cconclusion of a farce masquerading as a trial.\u201dblack pointed out that from the outset, washington and its allies blamed the donbass republics for shooting down the passenger airliner, despite no evidence that the militias even had access to the sophisticated buk antiaircraft missiles allegedly used in the crime but which kiev did have.\u201calso ignored was the eyewitness evidence of civilians on the ground who observed at least one kiev sukhoi su fighter jet ascend and approach the civilian airliner and that, immediately afterwards, the plane crashed. there were reports as well that a spanish air traffic controller in kiev, known as carlos, sent out messages on twitter contemporaneous with the shoot down, using the twitter address spainbuca, that he observed this on his radar and overheard the pilot\u2019s conversations with kiev air traffic control confirming that the ukraine jet shot down the plane. there are later reports that a ukrainian pilot admitted he flew the plane that shot it down. both these men have since disappeared from view. remarkably, the investigating body has never followed up these important facts,\u201d black emphasized.the observer noted that the hague has refused to follow up on any information related to the incident provided by the russian government, and pointed out that since the plane was downed in donbass territory, under international law, it should have been the donetsk people\u2019s republic which led the investigation into the plane\u2019s destruction, recognition or no recognition.\u201cbut the donetsk republic was denied that role by the kiev regime which claimed it took place in ukraine territory and so assumed the role of investigator and then, under nato, and especially american pressure, delegated the investigation to nato, in the guise of the dutch safety board, on the justification that the majority of the passengers were dutch,\u201d black said.black stressed that the dutch safety board\u2019sreport on the incident simply ignored any evidence pointing to kiev\u2019s responsibility for the plane\u2019s destruction, such as the holes found in the airliner\u2019s fuselage which \u201cmatch the mm cannon shells used by the kiev sukhoi su\u2026seen approaching the plane.\u201dblack also pointed to the mysterious januarydetention by dutch police of a pair of journalists and the seizure of their equipment, cameras, phones, notes and interview materials on mh, characterizing that incident as a blatant attempt by the dutch government to suppress the evidence these journalists gathered.it is only reasonable to conclude that the nato authorities are worried in case these journalists found evidence confirming nato culpability for the incident. after all, [they had written an article about it and announced that they were willing to share the information with the dutch government. but apparently there is a fear in nato that they might share too much with too many and so pounced on them and robbed them and us of the information they had before they could. the dutch government has yet to offer a legal justification for this seizure,\u201d the observer said.the hague district court found russian nationals igor girkin aka igor streklov and sergei dubinsky and ukrainian leonid kharchenko guilty in the downing of mh, sentencing them in absentia to life in jail. the men were also ordered to pay overmillion euros in compensation to the families of thevictims of the plane crash. moscow blasted the politicized decision.malaysia airlines boeingflight mh went down in the eastern donetsk peoples republic on july ,while on route from amsterdam to kuala lumpur. the planes route over the donbass was

law it should have been the donetsk people\u2019s republic which led the investigation into the plane\u2019s destruction recognition or no recognition \u201cbut the donetsk republic was denied that role by the kiev regime which claimed it took place in ukraine territory and so assumed the role of investigator and then under nato and especially american pressure delegated the investigation to nato in the guise of the dutch safety board on the justification that the majority of the passengers were dutch \u201d black said black stressed that the dutch safety board\u2019sreport on the incident simply ignored any evidence pointing to kiev\u2019s responsibility for the plane\u2019s destruction such as the holes found in the airliner\u2019s fuselage which \u201cmatch the mm cannon shells used by the kiev sukhoi su\u2026seen approaching the plane \u201dblack also pointed to the mysterious januarydetention by dutch police of a pair of journalists and the seizure of their equipment cameras phones notes and interview materials on mh characterizing that incident as a blatant attempt by the dutch government to suppress the evidence these journalists gathered it is only reasonable to conclude that the nato authorities are worried in case these journalists found evidence confirming nato culpability for the incident after all [they had written an article about it and announced that they were willing to share the information with the dutch government but apparently there is a fear in nato that they might share too much with too many and so pounced on them and robbed them and us of the information they had before they could the dutch government has yet to offer a legal justification for this seizure \u201d the observer said the hague district court found russian nationals igor girkin aka igor streklov and sergei dubinsky and ukrainian leonid kharchenko guilty in the downing of mh sentencing them in absentia to life in jail the men were also ordered to pay overmillion euros in compensation to the families of thevictims of the plane crash moscow blasted the politicized decision malaysia airlines boeingflight mh went down in the eastern donetsk peoples republic on july while on route from amsterdam to kuala lumpur the planes route over the donbass was approved by ukrainian authorities despite the fact that kiev forces and local militias were engaged in fierce clashes in the area allpeople aboard the aircraft were killed  "

            "Text": "will russia target nuclear plants? for ukrainians, it feels like a \u2018when\u2019, not an if jade mcglynn putin has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to do the unthinkable. this time, western allies must be prepared tuejul. edt last modified on tuejul. edt ver since russia launched its fullscale invasion of ukraine, westerncommentators , policyadvisers , andpolitical leaders have raised the spectre of nuclear war to argue against supplying ukrainians with weapons of selfdefence for fear of provoking russia. but this cautious approach could backfire, leading us closer to nuclear catastrophe. for ukrainians, the question of whether russia will sabotage the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant znpp, europe\u2019s largest, located in southern ukraine, has long been a \u201cwhen\u201d, not an \u201cif\u201d. last week, ukrainian civilians and officials shared panicked messages on social media as fears of a potential attack crystallised. russian embassies andvladimir putin\u2019s spokesperson appeared to be preparing disinformation lines, suggesting that ukraine, which suffered so terribly from the chornobyl nuclear accident, could deliberately unleash radioactive terror on its own people. while unconvincing, the rhetoric was an eerie and foreboding reminder of past kremlin disinformation campaigns following russian atrocities: theskripal poisonings , thebucha massacre , thedowning of passenger jet mh , and the destruction of thekakhovka dam the instinct by some of ukraine\u2019s allies to reduce the risk of russia turning to its nuclear arsenal is entirely correct, but the tactics are misguided. the west\u2019s mixed signals over its willingness to defend ukraine arewidely considered to have contributed to putin\u2019s decision to launch his genocidal war. since the invasionmonths ago, putin appears to have remained convinced that he has the \u201cstrategic patience\u201d tooutlast the west and assure his victory. in his defence, he can cite some compelling evidence to support his belief. after russia\u2019sannexation of crimea, the us and eu responsewas underwhelming \u2013 limited to symbolic but often ineffective personal sanctions. more recently, the international community\u2019smuted reaction to thekakhovka dam catastrophe will have hardly caused him to reconsider his strategy. but in the absence of aclear, coordinated plan to deal with russia\u2019s escalating nuclear threats, western leaders have edged us closer to the nuclear disaster they are seeking to avoid. russia possesses the world\u2019s largest nuclear arsenal, a dubious achievement it is not shy ofbroadcasting . a nuclear war would herald the end of global civilisation. even use of atactical nuclear weapon , resulting in a smaller explosion, would be a catastrophe for ukraine. any serious assessment of nuclear risk means not underestimating this. but it is also crucial that western leaders consider the consequences of being cowed by putin\u2019s threats, which are designed to force the world to indulge his rapacious appetite to destroyukraine . by providing ukraine with warwinning military support, the west can send a message to the kremlin \u2013 and any other irredentist powers \u2013 that using nuclear threats will not work. focusing on russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal alone distracts from more immediate threats, namely the allegedpositioning of explosives around znpp, which has been under occupation by russian armed forces since march . russia has amassed military personnel and equipment inside the facility, and there are reports that the children and families of ukrainian operators forced to work at znpp arebeing held hostage in russia , having been removed from the vicinity of the plant under the guise of \u201cevacuation\u201d. against the backdrop of ongoing russian war crimes in ukraine, the fear that the kremlin is preparing an act of nuclear terrorism is far from unreasonable. when this could occur or what this act might look like remains unclear. some experts suggest that it is likely russia will blow up a small part of the plant, such as a cooled reactor, to display what it is capable of, or to slow down the ukrainian counteroffensive. this would be unlikely to lead toradiation leakage \u2013 but there are also much riskier scenarios. astronger explosion could cause damage to the protective shell of a reactor, spreading radiation approximatelymiles from the site of the blast and creating a disaster of catastrophic scale. perhaps the threats can be dismissed as part of russia\u2019s information warfare \u2013 another way to terrorise the ukrainian civilian population. last week, ukrainian civilians were killed by russian missiles in lviv, ukraine\u2019s most western and peaceful city. but nuclear catastrophe is not something to leave to chance or half measures. the viennabased international atomic energy agency iaea has worked under trying conditions to ensure the safety of the plant, but it has lost the confidence of many in ukraine. in its latest inspection, the iaea insisted the plant was secure but also requested further access, as it was prevented from viewing parts of the site whereukrainian officials claim mines have been planted. this situation is untenable. much more robust action is needed to restore nuclear safety, and confidence. the best possible chance of demilitarising and deoccupying znpp would involve a multilateral taskforce formed of parties trusted by all sides, including the us, china, india, the uk and the eu, which could supervise the area around the station with iaea support and expertise. in the absence of such efforts, much of europe remains hostage to fortune. world leaders must now face up to some tough decisions, rather than giving in once more to russian blackmail or ignoring the problem until it starts to radiate into ukraine\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 and beyond.",

closer to nuclear catastrophe for ukrainians the question of whether russia will sabotage the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant znpp europe\u2019s largest located in southern ukraine has long been a \u201cwhen\u201d not an \u201cif\u201d last week ukrainian civilians and officials shared panicked messages on social media as fears of a potential attack crystallised russian embassies andvladimir putin\u2019s spokesperson appeared to be preparing disinformation lines suggesting that ukraine which suffered so terribly from the chornobyl nuclear accident could deliberately unleash radioactive terror on its own people while unconvincing the rhetoric was an eerie and foreboding reminder of past kremlin disinformation campaigns following russian atrocities theskripal poisonings thebucha massacre thedowning of passenger jet mh and the destruction of thekakhovka dam the instinct by some of ukraine\u2019s allies to reduce the risk of russia turning to its nuclear arsenal is entirely correct but the tactics are misguided the west\u2019s mixed signals over its willingness to defend ukraine arewidely considered to have contributed to putin\u2019s decision to launch his genocidal war since the invasionmonths ago putin appears to have remained convinced that he has the \u201cstrategic patience\u201d tooutlast the west and assure his victory in his defence he can cite some compelling evidence to support his belief after russia\u2019sannexation of crimea the us and eu responsewas underwhelming \u2013 limited to symbolic but often ineffective personal sanctions more recently the international community\u2019smuted reaction to thekakhovka dam catastrophe will have hardly caused him to reconsider his strategy but in the absence of aclear coordinated plan to deal with russia\u2019s escalating nuclear threats western leaders have edged us closer to the nuclear disaster they are seeking to avoid russia possesses the world\u2019s largest nuclear arsenal a dubious achievement it is not shy ofbroadcasting a nuclear war would herald the end of global civilisation even use of atactical nuclear weapon resulting in a smaller explosion would be a catastrophe for ukraine any serious assessment of nuclear risk means not underestimating this but it is also crucial that western leaders consider the consequences of being cowed by putin\u2019s threats which are designed to force the world to indulge his rapacious appetite to destroyukraine by providing ukraine with warwinning military support the west can send a message to the kremlin \u2013 and any other irredentist powers \u2013 that using nuclear threats will not work focusing on russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal alone distracts from more immediate threats namely the allegedpositioning of explosives around znpp which has been under occupation by russian armed forces since march russia has amassed military personnel and equipment inside the facility and there are reports that the children and families of ukrainian operators forced to work at znpp arebeing held hostage in russia having been removed from the vicinity of the plant under the guise of \u201cevacuation\u201d against the backdrop of ongoing russian war crimes in ukraine the fear that the kremlin is preparing an act of nuclear terrorism is far from unreasonable when this could occur or what this act might look like remains unclear some experts suggest that it is likely russia will blow up a small part of the plant such as a cooled reactor to display what it is capable of or to slow down the ukrainian counteroffensive this would be unlikely to lead toradiation leakage \u2013 but there are also much riskier scenarios astronger explosion could cause damage to the protective shell of a reactor spreading radiation approximatelymiles from the site of the blast and creating a disaster of catastrophic scale perhaps the threats can be dismissed as part of russia\u2019s information warfare \u2013 another way to terrorise the ukrainian civilian population last week ukrainian civilians were killed by russian missiles in lviv ukraine\u2019s most western and peaceful city but nuclear catastrophe is not something to leave to chance or half measures the viennabased international atomic energy agency iaea has worked under trying conditions to ensure the safety of the plant but it has lost the confidence of many in ukraine in its latest inspection the iaea insisted the plant was secure but also requested further access as it was prevented from viewing parts of the site whereukrainian officials claim mines have been planted this situation is untenable much more robust action is needed to restore nuclear safety and confidence the best possible chance of demilitarising and deoccupying znpp would involve a multilateral taskforce formed of parties trusted by all sides including the us china india the uk and the eu which could supervise the area around the station with iaea support and expertise in the absence of such efforts much of europe remains hostage to fortune world leaders must now face up to some tough decisions rather than giving in once more to russian blackmail or ignoring the problem until it starts to radiate into ukraine\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 and beyond  "

cluster munitions, also called cluster bombs, are canisters that carry tens to hundreds of smaller bomblets, also known as submunitions. the canisters can be dropped from aircraft, launched from missiles or fired from artillery, naval guns or rocket launchers. the canisters break open at a prescribed height, depending upon the area of the intended target, and the bomblets inside spread out over that area. they are fused by a timer to explode closer to or on the ground, spreading shrapnel that is designed to kill troops or take out armored vehicles such as tanks. a cluster bomb capsule at the frontline city of avdiivka, ukraine on march , .andre luis alvesanadolu agencygetty images what type of cluster bomb is the us said to be giving to ukraine? the us has a stockpile of cluster munitions known as dpicms, or dualpurpose improved conventional munitions, that it no longer uses after phasing them out in .according to an article on the us army\u2019s earmor website, the dpicms washington will give to kyiv are fired from mm howitzers, with each canister carryingbomblets. each bomblet has a lethal range of aboutsquare meters, so a single canister can cover an area up to , square meters about . acres, depending upon the height it releases the bomblets. the bomblets in a dpicm have shaped charges that, when striking a tank or armored vehicle, \u201ccreate a metallic jet that perforates metallic armor,\u201d the article says, adding that it can takeor more bomblets to destroy an armored vehicle, but it may take only one to disable the armored vehicle\u2019s weapons or render it immobile. what are cluster munitions? cluster munitions contain multiple explosives that are released over an area up to the size of several football fields. they can be dropped from a plane or launched from the ground or sea. the submunitions are released in flight and fall to the ground. they can range from the tens to many hundreds they are designed to explode on impact but as many as a third don\u2019t, and remain a deadly risk to civilians for years to comeof recorded cluster bomb casualties are civilians, of which almostare children note: cluster munitions can vary widely in design and scale, this graphic only aims to explain their general function. source: geneva international centre for humanitarian demining, cluster munition coalition graphic: connie chen and henrik pettersson, cnn have cluster bombs been used in the war in ukraine before? yes, both the ukrainians and the russians have used cluster bombs since moscow\u2019s forces invaded in february . more recently, ukrainian forces have begun using turkishprovided cluster munitions on the battlefield. but ukrainian officials have been pushing the us to provide its cluster munitions since last year, arguing that they would provide more ammunition for westernprovided artillery and rocket systems, and help narrow russia\u2019s numerical superiority in artillery. why are cluster munitions more controversial than other bombs? as the bomblets fall over a wide area, they can endanger noncombatants.in addition, somewhere betweentoof the munitions fail, according to the international committee of the red cross. the unexploded munitions can then be detonated by civilian activity years or even decades later. the cluster munition coalition, an activist group trying to get the weapons banned everywhere, says potentially deadly cluster submunitions still lie dormant in laos and vietnamyears after their use. a us defense official told cnn the munitions washington would be sending to ukraine have a \u201cdud rate\u201d of . or lower, based on livefire testing done as recently as . however, critics have raised questions about the military\u2019s testing process, including whether it was done in ideal conditions, or tested under different weather and terrain conditions that might affect how the munition reacts. the defense official did not address whether the munitions were tested under those different conditions.announcement exposes divisions the white house is defending its transfer of the weapons, despite the concerns on the possible effects on civilians. \u201cwhile russia is using them in ukraine in an aggressive war on another country and indiscriminately killing civilians, the ukrainians will be using these cluster munitions \u2013 obviously, which have a very low dud rate, but they\u2019ll be using to defend their own territory hitting russian positions,\u201d national security council coordinator for strategic communications john kirby told abc on sunday. \u201cwe can all agree that more civilians have been and will continue to be killed by russian forces with whether it\u2019s cluster munitions drones, missile attacks, or just frontal assaults, then will likely be hurt by the use of these cluster munitions fired at russian positions inside ukrainian territory,\u201d kirby added. reacting to kirby\u2019s comments, the russian embassy in washington condemned the decision likening it to \u201cwar crimes.\u201d in a statement friday, human rights watch said both ukraine and russia had killed civilians with their use of cluster munitions in the war so far. \u201ccluster munitions remain one of the world\u2019s most treacherous weapons. they kill and maim indiscriminately and cause widespread human suffering,\u201d gilles carbonnier, vice president of the international committee of the red cross, said at a conference on the munition in switzerland last year. \u201cany use of cluster munitions, anywhere, by anyone, must be condemned,\u201d carbonnier said. much of the world has banned the use of these weapons through the convention on cluster munitions ccm, which also prohibits the stockpiling, production and transfer of them.thoughnations have joined that convention, the united states, ukraine, russia andother countries have not. using the munitions to attack enemy troops or vehicles is not illegal under international law, but striking civilians with the weapons could amount to a war crime, according to human rights watch. british prime minister rishi sunak said on saturday his country, a key nato ally, is a signatory to the treaty banning cluster munitions, and \u201cdiscourages\u201d their use. another nato ally, spain, put forth even stronger opposition to the transfer. \u201cwhile respecting the decisions of the sovereign country of the united states, spain does not share their judgment in sending cluster bombs, we are against sending cluster bombs,\u201d spanish defense minister magarita robles said. where have cluster bombs been used before?

auditor, could only find a job planting trees in a local forestry. elena tried her luck at a fish processing factory. the physically demanding jobs were not enough to make ends meet. back in ukraine,

offered an unusual degree of support and hospitality, for most ukrainians, it was not enough to build a new life. many ukrainians abroad struggle financially, find it hard to integrate into host societies and, most importantly, suffer from being separated from their loved ones. displaced women and children are mostly on their own, and families face the prospect of being split indefinitely.

the family pooled all its savings to buy a rundown, abandoned house in a village, and now olga struggles to make it habitable while operating, essentially, as a single mother. in ukraine, housing for people displaced by the war is scarce and inadequate. most often, they are temporarily hosted in public facilities such as schools or kindergartens. families like olgas are often on their own to deal with their problems. as ukraine struggles to fight a war of attrition against a stronger adversary, civilians displaced by the fighting feel they are low on the countrys list of priorities. internal refugees report to aid workers and journalists that when approaching authorities with their problems, they are often turned away and advised not to be selfish and to remember that soldiers on the front lines have it even worse. enlarge this image svitlana and her son danil in a dormitory room in sloviansk, donetsk region, where they lived before evacuating from donbas. june . anastasia

as pendular, noting that people tend to travel back and forth, rather than exclusively out of the country. mirroring this definition are the hesitations of those ukrainians who try to navigate the

part to a surge of ukrainian refugees. many are semiskilled and highly motivated workers, entering the u.s. legally and through special emergency programs. they are not only easing intenseworker shortages in hospitality, retail and other service industries, but are helping drive up employment for the entire country. people born outside the u.s. make up just . of the american workingage population, but foreignborn workersyears and older accounted for a whoppingof the nation\u2019s labor force growth in the twoyear period that ended in may, with women making an outsized contribution,

venezuelan community, the nation\u2019s largest members of the country\u2019s largest venezuelan community in miami have had mixed reactions to gov. ron desantis\u2019 treatment of immigrants, including his decision to transport migrants to other states. migrants from abroad have long been an expanding part of the u.s. labor market, offsetting an aging population and other drags on growth. but their labor participation relative to u.s.born workers has accelerated further since coming out of the pandemic, thanks to arebound in normal legal immigration and the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees, most notably from ukraine.adding to that are emerging social and economic conditions that are driving more immigrant women to work rather than stay at home.statistics now show that the labor participation rate of foreignborn women blew past record levels this year and has nearly caught up with that of u.s.born women, whose numbers are still below prepandemic levels. \u201cwe\u2019re already seeing immigration becoming increasingly important in supporting labor force growth, and it willbecome even more important ,\u201d said julia gelatt, a senior analyst at the nonpartisan migration policy institute. advertisement beyond filling employers\u2019 immediate needs, these newcomers are expected to provide a critical cushion to a u.s. workforce hit by both shortterm and longerrunning forces:retirements and a surge in workers quitting jobs postpandemic; declining birthrates; and rising deaths, includingdrugrelated fatalities , suicides and other socalled deaths of despair. since russia\u2019s invasion of ukraine last year, some , people from that wartorn country have arrived in the u.s., many under the biden administration\u2019s\u201cuniting for ukraine\u201d program. about , afghans have come since the fall of kabul in the late summer of , and tens of thousands more from venezuela and cuba, among other countries, are being admitted for humanitarian reasons. individuals entering under urgent refugee and parole programs can secure work permits relatively quickly. they can generally stay for at least two years. some have come with university degrees and needed skills like nursing. others are eagerly fillinglowerpaying openings at restaurants, hotels, retail stores and nursing homes \u2014 jobs that u.s. citizens are largely passing up. vita bohera and nadia senkiv are from the lviv region in western ukraine. sponsored by relatives in the u.s., the two distant cousins landed in portland, ore., at the end of august. by november, bohera and senkiv, who are both in their s, got work authorization papers. \u201ci was just sitting at home thinking, \u2018what am i going to do in this country?\u2019\u201d said bohera, a university graduate who worked as an english teacher in ukraine. she began browsing facebook pages for job opportunities. after two months of training, bohera found work as a medical interpreter, earningtoan hour. sometimes she drives long distances for appointments. \u201cthe company usually pays for mileage, which is great,\u201d she said. bohera came with her two children, agesand , but not her husband. most men in ukraine are held back because of the potential call for military service. senkiv, , does not have children but also left her husband in ukraine and is staying with her younger brother, who has been in the u.s. for several years. her path to employment was different. in her hometown of drohobych, senkiv attended vocational school after completing basic ninthgrade education. she worked for a company preparing dumplings and other readymade foods. in portland, she learned of a job opening from a woman attending the same ukrainian church. since march, senkiv has been working as a fulltime cook at a preschool in southeast portland. she also has a second job, putting in two hours at night clearing tables and washing dishes at a senior living center for . an hour. senkiv doesn\u2019t make a lot more at the preschool, and she\u2019s quickly learned of a common american irritant: \u201cmy salary is ok, but taxes are high.\u201d still, senkiv says she is happy with her job \u2014 she loves working with kids. \u201cthe children like to hug. we don\u2019t hug so much in ukraine,\u201d she said, her words translated by her cousin. world amp; nation sleepless in kyiv: in ukraine\u2019s capital, the stress of war weighs on everyone. how do people cope? how do citizens of kyiv cope with the sleep deprivation and stress from russia\u2019s war on ukraine? some push it down, some try yoga or dancing. working in the kitchen or at a senior facility are amongmany service jobs that have gone begging, especially since the country has come out of the pandemic. even amid modest economic growth, there were more thanmillion openings in the u.s. this spring \u2014 almost two jobs for every officially unemployed person, according to the latest government figures. job vacancies were up more thanin healthcare and social assistance establishments compared withbefore the pandemic, and they were upat lodging and food service businesses, where turnover is rampant. rough estimates indicate that as many as , positions that include dishwashing duties may be available, based on job listings in indeed. immigrants make up an especially big part of the workforce at hotels and restaurants. marriott international says it has hired more thanrefugees in the u.s. since last year. it is one of a dozen companies in lodging, manufacturing, cleaning and other services that have pledged to hire , refugees over three years. \u201cwe\u2019re in a unique moment, politically and economically,\u201d said yaron schwartz, the u.s. director for tent partnership for refugees, a nonprofit mobilizing companies to hire and train refugees. there are other reasons for the rise in labor participation among immigrant women. like women overall, those foreignborn are increasingly better educated, which means they\u2019re more likely to be working.economic pressures also are pushing traditional immigrant households to put stayathome moms into outside work, especially given the last couple of years of high inflation. \u201cit\u2019s almost a necessity,\u201d said naomi cruz, a glendale immigration attorney who had been the l.a. lead at the latinista, agroup promoting careers and entrepreneurs among latinas. nearly onethird of latinos in the u.s. are foreignborn. in more recent years asia has been the leading source of immigrants, and among women, census bureau statistics show that those from india have seen the biggest employment gains, likely reflecting more spouses of tech workers with hb visas in the job market. overall, net immigration to the u.s., including refugees, exceededmillion betweenand . that was more than double the number in each of the prior two years, when the pandemic and other bordertightening policies under the trump administration brought international migration to a decades low. experts don\u2019t expect such big increases in immigration in the years ahead because of caps under u.s. law, but various humanitarian programs allowing up to , people a month from venezuela, cuba, haiti and nicaragua are likely to continue to boost the numbers. these and others from abroad are expected to become increasingly important for the labor force as the u.s. joins other advanced economies caught in a demographic squeeze. especially for states like california, international migration is the difference between a growing or shrinking population, especially as many appear to be moving out of the state because of its high living costs.just how many of the refugees will reside in the u.s. and work beyond two years is unknown. viktoriia gorbachevska, , who quickly found work as a business analyst in raleigh, n.c., since arriving from ukraine in november after getting matched with a sponsor throughwelcome connect, isn\u2019t sure. but she sees a lot of potential to build a future in the u.s.\u201cthis country is good for educated young people starting work here,\u201d said gorbachevska, who has a master\u2019s degree and is married with two young children. the biden administration has already created a pathway for afghan nationals to extend their stay, and many refugees in general are expected to seek permanent status through asylum and other programs. zakira, who asked that her last name not be used because of security concerns, fled kabul on aug. , , just four days after the taliban captured the capital city. \u201cthat day was hard for me,\u201d zakira said as she recalled working at a hospital as panic swept her family. \u201cmy dad called me. \u2018where are you? why are you at work?\u2019\u201d zakira, , and her yearold sister first arrived in qatar, then found transport to washington, d.c. and after two months at a base in texas, the two sisters settled in portland. zakira was a nurse in afghanistan, and she initially found employment at a nursing home. then at the end of last year, she left for a betterpaying job at a hospital caring for patients. she is now getting training in phlebotomy. her sister is attending high school, and the two live in a onebedroom apartment in downtown portland. in kabul, they left behind their parents, as well as a brother and older sister married with children. zakira said she fled because she wanted to get away from a regime that \u201cended the dreams\u201d for girls and women wanting to go to school or pursue a career. \u201cit\u2019s good,\u201d she said of opportunities in the u.s. \u201cwe can study, we can work. but it\u2019s hard for me,\u201d she added. \u201ci have a plan, but without my family it\u2019s

could zaporizhzhia become another chernobyl? and what good, if any, would this do for russia in its war on ukraine?here\u2019s what you need to know. what is the current situation? in june, zelensky said ukrainian intelligence had \u201creceived information that russia is considering a scenario of a terrorist attack at the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant znpp,\u201d and that the alleged attack would involve \u201cradiation leakage.\u201dukraine\u2019s military intelligence chief, kyrylo budanov, told state tv that the russians had mined the zaporizhzhia plant. \u201cthe most horrifying part is that a cooler is mined. if they disable it by blowing it up\u2026 there is a great chance that there will be significant problems.\u201d the kremlindenied the allegations zelensky significantly escalated this rhetoric in his address on tuesday night. \u201cthe whole world must now realize that common security depends entirely on global attention to the actions of the occupiers at the plant,\u201d he said. as ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive attempts to reclaim territory captured by russia, including in the zaporizhzhia region, analysts have said that russia may be mounting a false flag operation \u2013 a military action designed to look like it was perpetrated by the opponent. that is, russia may claim that any explosion at the power plant was the result of reckless ukrainian shelling, rather than its own explosives. throughout the war, russia has warned that ukrainian shelling around the plant could lead to a radioactive incident. \u201cit\u2019s rhetorical signaling meant to accuse ukraine of nuclear irresponsibility, and then also to discourage ukraine from conducting counteroffensive operations into the occupied zaporizhzhia oblast,\u201d karolina hird, a russia analyst at the institute for the study of war, told cnn. kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov told reporters wednesday that the situation at the plant is \u201cquite tense,\u201d but tried to deflect criticism, claiming that the potential for \u201csabotage by the kyiv regime\u201d is \u201chigh\u201d and could have \u201ccatastrophic consequences.\u201d \u201ctherefore, of course, all measures are being taken to counter this threat,\u201d peskov said. the international atomic energy agency iaea \u2013 the united nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog \u2013 said in an update wednesday that there were no visible indications of mines or explosives at the znpp, but requested additional access to the site for confirmation. \u201caccess to the rooftops of reactor unitsandis essential, as well as access to the turbine halls and some parts of the cooling system of the plant,\u201d iaea director general rafael grossi said in a statement. who controls the power plant? the znpp \u2013 the largest in europe \u2013 lies along the banks of the dnipro river, next to the town of enerhodar. it has been under full russian control since march last year, but is operated mostly by ukrainian staff, who were initiallyforced to work at \u201cgunpoint\u201d by invading russian troops, according to petro kotin, head of ukraine\u2019s nuclear power operator energoatom. when the war began on february, one of the plant\u2019s six reactor units was closed for maintenance. after russian forces took control of the plant, the ukrainian workers shut down the remaining units. butfighting continued to rage around the plant last summer, to the grave alarm of the iaea. grossi, claiming that \u201cevery principle of nuclear safety\u201d had been \u201cviolated\u201d at the plant, managed tosecure his staff a visit to the site in august, while it remained under russian control. grossi points on a map of the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, march . joe klamarafpgetty imagesfile grossi\u2019s \u201cpersonal diplomacy,\u201d and the \u201cbravery\u201d of the staff who accompanied him on this visit, played a huge role in decreasing the chance of a nuclear accident at the plant, according to william alberque, director of strategy, technology and arms control at the international institute for strategy studies. \u201cwhat grossi is doing is completely unprecedented in the history of the iaea,\u201d alberque told cnn. \u201cthe whole thing was saying: russia\u2019s basically going to have to kill me, in order for me not to make this nuclear power plant more safe. it was astonishing.\u201d the iaea staff\u2019s mission, alberque said, was to \u201cestablish a precedent here, that we\u2019re willing to get involved and to try to take this chess piece off the board.\u201d is the plant still active? russian occupiers, however, continued to prevent ukrainian operators from putting each of the reactors into a safer \u201ccold shutdown\u201d status. this means when the reactor\u2019s temperature is below boiling point but electrical pumps moving water through the core must still keep working to cool the fuel and avoid meltdown \u2013 which requires an external power supply. the safety of the plant was threatened further by the breach of the nova kakhovka dam on june , which lowered water levels used for cooling the plant precipitously. ukraine accused russia ofdeliberately destroying the dam \u2013 a claim that moscow has denied. shortly after this, the final reactor unit at znpp was put into cold shutdown status on june . hence, due to the actions of the iaea and ukrainian operating staff, the plant has been put into a more stable \u201ccold shutdown\u201d mode, limiting the chances of a largescale nuclear disaster. the zaporizhzhia plant seen from the banks of the dnipro on june , after the nova kakhovka dam collapse. alina smutkoreuters could this be another chernobyl?because the plant\u2019s reactors have been cooled, no. if the reported explosives were to detonate, this would \u201copen up a cold reactor, which would expose spent fuel to the air, which will spread some radiation,\u201d alberque told cnn. \u201ca plume will come off from the reactor where there will be radiation aerosolized,\u201d he said. this would create a radiation zone where \u201cyou\u2019ll have a higher chance of cancer over the nextyears,\u201d but will not recreate the sort of destruction seen after the meltdown of the active chernobyl plant in . \u201cthe six reactors at znpp are not at all like the chernobyl reactor and cannot, can not, have the same kind of accident,\u201d cheryl rofer, a nuclear expert and former researcher at the los alamos national laboratory, wrote in a blog. \u201cchernobyl had a graphite moderator, and the building it was in was not the heavily reinforced concrete of the reactors at znpp. the znpp reactors have hard oxide fuel encased in metal, and are inside a stainless steel vessel. chernobyl had no such vessel,\u201d she added. according to alberque, the scale of the effects of any disaster at zaporizhzhia would be more akin to that atthree mile island in pennsylvania in , rather than chernobyl\u2013 or evenfukushima rescuers attend an antiradiation drill on june , in case of an emergency at the znpp. stringerreuters would a nuclear incident benefit russia? it is unclear how russia would benefit from causing an explosion at the plant. \u201cthe winds are blowing east. so it\u2019s going to affect russians. in terms of military effectiveness: zero. it\u2019s just stupid,\u201d alberque said. any nuclear incident would \u201cjust be selfharm. it would just harm russianheld territory\u2026 i don\u2019t get the play.\u201d as well as not providing clear military strategic gains for russia, causing a nuclear incident may backfire diplomatically. the financial timesreported that chinese president xi jinping has personally warned putin against using nuclear weapons in ukraine, according to western and chinese officials.the kremlin denied the report, calling it \u201cfiction.\u201d however, it adds to the sense that russia\u2019s continued nuclear threats are causing reputational damage among its supposed allies. warring parties do not tend to raise the nuclear specter lightly. india and pakistan, despite being locked in conflict for decades, agreed into exclude nuclear facilities from their conflict zones, recognizing the risk that such attacks pose. they have exchanged a list of their nuclear facilities every year sinceto avoid any accidents. hence russia\u2019s reckless threats may contribute to further isolation on the world stage. \u201cif putin were to do this [cause an explosion at the znpp, how does india \u2013 whose line is, \u2018unlike pakistan, we\u2019re the responsible nuclear power\u2019 \u2013 how do they say that if we\u2019re friends with the guy who just blew up a nuclear power plant?\u201d alberque said.",

gift article share tomakivka, ukraine \u2014 the risk of a major disaster at the nearby zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant terrifies nadiya hez, who lives in an area that would probably take the brunt of any deadly radioactive fallout. the nuclear plant has been in continual danger as russian and ukrainian troops trade fire in its vicinity, but the chance of a meltdown has increased sharply since the destruction of the kakhovka dam just downstream. the junebreach unleashed a catastrophic flood and jeopardized the supply of water needed to cool the plant\u2019s reactors and spent fuel. advertisement but there have been so many horrors since russia invaded last year that hez and others in this ukrainian town have responded to the threat of a nuclear disaster with a mix of dread and hardened fatalism. hez, who is a nurse, at least has iodine tablets on hand to mitigate the effects of radiation poisoning. after days of searching, she located a key to the root cellar outside their sovietera home that could serve as a crude fallout shelter for her, her husband and their yearold son, ihor, should radiation escape from the russianheld nuclear power plant aboutmiles away. there has been little else to do except wait and focus on the daily hardships the war has already inflicted upon their lives. zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant ; replace blank placeholder image with actual

system was knocked out when the dam went. warnings from ukrainian officials and atomic energy experts about a potential disaster in southeastern ukraine have gained urgency since the dam\u2019s breach. ukrainian officials accuse russian forces of deliberately blowing up part of the dam, an allegation moscow has denied. what to know about ukraine\u2019s zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as far back as october, ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky predicted that russia would destroy the dam. now, zelensky and other senior ukrainian officials have upped the tempo of warnings that russian forces plan to sabotage the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest such facility in europe. maj. gen. kyrylo budanov, who heads ukraine\u2019s military intelligence, said through a spokesman that russians have planted explosives next to four of the six reactors and mined the cooling pond used to supply water to chill the reactors and spent fuel. \u201cthere is an extremely high risk of human error or, given the amount of explosives, an accidental detonation,\u201d spokesman andriy yusov said. on friday, the military intelligence agency issued an ominous update, saying that the three russian supervisors had evacuated and ukrainian employees signed to work for the russian state nuclear power conglomerate should depart by july . the report also said that personnel remaining behind had been told to \u201cblame ukraine in case of any emergencies.\u201d advertisement earlier this week, ihor klymenko, who heads the ministry of internal affairs, announced training exercises at all levels of government to deal with a possible nuclear disaster. these have included planning for evacuations within a certain radius of the plant, road closures and the creation of checkpoints to screen people for radiation exposure. for residents unable to evacuate in time, officials have urged sheltering in place, making sure to shut off ventilation and air conditioners and seal up windows with dampened cloth and tape. when outdoors, he said, people should wear masks that can filter out airborne radioactive dust and other particles. iaea chief pushes plan to secure nuclear plant ahead of ukraine offensive klymenko and other officials have also urged the public to remain calm \u2014 advice that many ukrainians seem to have taken to heart, despite their country\u2019s history with chernobyl, the site of the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster, and nine years of violent conflict with russia. \u201cpeople are already hardened, resilient,\u201d said yuriy malashko, the head of the

ukraine\u2019s national academy of sciences who has studied nuclear power plant disasters. the situation led the international atomic energy agency\u2019s general director to conduct an emergency inspection of the nuclear plant days after the dam breach. in a statement posted on the iaea\u2019s website, rafael mariano grossi said thecooling pond is being replenished with water from a discharge

mixture of hydrogen gas and steam that could rupture the containment structure and blow dangerous amounts of radiation into the air. the reactors could melt down anywhere fromhours to two weeks without water, budanov said. what could happen then? pareniuk and other experts said it is unlikely to be anything like chernobyl, which blew when the reactor was in active operation. she said the most likely worstcase scenario could be something on scale with thefukushima disaster in , when fuel in three of the japanese nuclear plant\u2019s four reactors melted down following a massive earthquake and tsunami. if so, a poisonous cloud could spread across ukraine, contaminating its agricultural heartland and probably drifting over european neighbors with radioactive particles that increase the risk of certain cancers. radioactive contamination is likely to reach the dnieper river, too, flowing into the black sea. depending on water currents, the contamination could touch every

on the telegram app in recent weeks that he wants to help his friend \u201cdenis\u201d in ukraine and plans to travel there to establish a neonazi pipeline of volunteer soldiers to the cause. in the

boost for russian propagandists who frequently accuse kyiv of being a kind of fourth reich. mostly composed of russian ultranationalists with the stated goal ofoverthrowing the russian federation ,

ukraine is another question. with an ongoing civilian flight ban in ukraine, pohlhaus would have to enter the country through bordering nations like poland, theusual border of entry for foreign volunteers, or romania, a country that has recentlyshown a willingness to arrest extremistsfrom abroad. both countries are in the nato alliance, with policing and intelligence apparatuses that cooperate with u.s. authorities. the ukrainians, for their part, have shown very little interest in allowing neonazis like pohlhaus to join their war effort. as far back as october , ukrainian

country\u2019s military efforts in the eastern donbas region, which at the time was the site of trench warfare with prorussian forces. kacper rekawek, an expert on the flow of foreign fighters to the war in ukraine and a nonresident research fellow at thecounter extremism project , says that while there are neonazis from abroad in ukraine, the problem shouldn\u2019t be overblown. \u201cit;s certainly not as bad as the russian propaganda wants us to believe,\u201d said rekawek. \u201cthe caution is warranted, and what i see is there is excitement amongst those farright types, online and offline.\u201d according to rekawek, there are very few neonazi foreigners fighting on the front lines, while groups like casapound in italy, another fascist and nationalist political organization, have sent \u201cobservation\u201d missions to ukraine. \u201csome of them take some supplies, they;re usually medical, or some tactical gear, but of course, not weapons,\u201d rekawek said, who added that \u201ctalk of a pipeline\u201d of neonazis into the war is exaggerated. while groups like the rvc have called for new recruits, nonrussian and ukrainianspeaking foreigners who once joined the war in droves, regardless of political ideology, don\u2019t typically last on the front lines, nor can they be trained as effectively for combat. \u201cthe capacity of these guys to offer meaningful change on the front lines is limited,\u201d said rekawek, referring to farright travelers operating within the ukrainian war effort. \u201cthese organizations are no charity, they;re not there to train you.\u201d there were initial fears among counterterrorism experts that the war in ukraine could potentially attract a global movement of neonazis, leading to the formation of an islamic statelike network. but a year and half into the war, most authorities acknowledge that ukrainehasn\u2019t yet become a destination for the farright movement. nonetheless, american law enforcement officials have voiced serious concerns about people like pohlhaus traveling to ukraine, fighting in the war, and then coming home. at the outset of the invasion in march , an internal customs and border protectionreport warned that american extremists interrogated at john f. kennedy international airport in new york before their departure flights were on their way to \u201cjoin the conflict.\u201d the bulletin openly wondered what kinds of skills those types of \u201cforeign fighters\u201d could learn in ukraine that could then \u201cproliferate; in \u201cu.s.based militia and white nationalist groups\u201d once they returned home. whatever the outcome of his latest call to volunteer for the conflict, or if it;s simply a bluff to attract more funding to hispersonal cause , pohlhaus acknowledged it could be a while before the blood tribe appears in ukraine. he told his followers that it would take time to pool resources and even vehicles in order to be autonomous on the front lines. \u201cat the end of the day, this is very much ukraine;s issue,\u201d said rekawek, who thinks that farright elements within the ukrainian military structure could be a problem when it comes to european union or nato membership for the country. \u201cit;s up to ukraine to call the shots. and it will certainly be an issue, but further down the line.\u201d",

Kacper Rekawek an expert on the flow of foreign fighters to the war in ukraine and a nonresident research fellow at thecounter extremism project says that while there are neonazis from abroad in ukraine the problem shouldn\u2019t be overblown \u201cit s certainly not as bad as the russian propaganda wants us to believe \u201d said rekawek \u201cthe caution is warranted and what i see is there is excitement amongst those farright types online and offline \u201d according to rekawek there are very few neonazi foreigners fighting on the front lines while groups like casapound in italy another fascist and nationalist political organization have sent \u201cobservation\u201d missions to ukraine \u201csome of them take some supplies they re usually medical or some tactical gear but of course not weapons \u201d rekawek said who added that \u201ctalk of a pipeline\u201d of neonazis into the war is exaggerated while groups like the rvc have called for new recruits nonrussian and ukrainianspeaking foreigners who once joined the war in droves regardless of political ideology don\u2019t typically last on the front lines nor can they be trained as effectively for combat \u201cthe capacity of these guys to offer meaningful change on the front lines is limited \u201d said rekawek referring to farright travelers operating within the ukrainian war effort \u201cthese organizations are no charity they re not there to train you \u201d there were initial fears among counterterrorism experts that the war in ukraine could potentially attract a global movement of neonazis leading to the formation of an islamic statelike network but a year and half into the war most authorities acknowledge that ukrainehasn\u2019t yet become a destination for the farright movement nonetheless american law enforcement officials have voiced serious concerns about people like pohlhaus traveling to ukraine fighting in the war and then coming home at the outset of the invasion in march an internal customs and border protectionreport warned that american extremists interrogated at john f kennedy international airport in new york before their departure flights were on their way to \u201cjoin the conflict \u201d the bulletin openly wondered what kinds of skills those types of \u201cforeign fighters\u201d could learn in ukraine that could then \u201cproliferate in \u201cu s based militia and white nationalist groups\u201d once they returned home whatever the outcome of his latest call to volunteer for the conflict or if it s simply a bluff to attract more funding to hispersonal cause pohlhaus acknowledged it could be a while before the blood tribe appears in ukraine he told his followers that it would take time to pool resources and even vehicles in order to be autonomous on the front lines \u201cat the end of the day this is very much ukraine s issue \u201d said rekawek who thinks that farright elements within the ukrainian military structure could be a problem when it comes to european union or nato membership for the country \u201cit s up to ukraine to call the shots and it will certainly be an issue but further down the line \u201d "

arrowright vladimir putin\u2019s russia is known for its ability to fight wars on a relatively small budget. the war in ukraine is no exception. according to the stockholm international peace research institute, russia\u2019s military spending was about\u00a0. of gross domestic product inand should not exceed that\u00a0by much this year. israelspent . of its gdp on defense last year.\u00a0 the headline number\u00a0doesn\u2019t include indirect warrelated outlays, such as on construction in occupied areas and in russian border regions damaged by ukrainian shelling. but it\u2019s a manageable amount. sipri has this to say in areport published last week: advertisement for ukraine, it is without question a fullscale war for the country\u2019s very existence as an independent state. but russia has been engaged in the conflict in a more limited manner, as if seeking to minimize its economic cost and the impact on domestic society and on the president\u2019s goals for the country. it is being fought in reality not with the resources of a fullscale war but indeed as a more limited military operation...\u00a0it is an operation being fought in monetary terms at a cost that the russian economy can afford, notwithstanding severe sanctions. the low financial cost of the war may be\u00a0a major reason why putin appears to believe that time is on his side and why he\u00a0isn\u2019t actively seeking peace in ukraine. however,\u00a0the tight budget appears to have been spent rather inefficiently compared with\u00a0how\u00a0wagner put to use its government funding. at a meeting with service members last week,\u00a0putin said wagner\u2019s participation in the ukraine invasion was fully financed by the russian government. from may\u00a0 through april\u00a0, it was funded\u00a0to the tune of . billion rublesmillion for regular pay, . billion rubles for bonuses and . billion rubles for \u201cinsurance payments,\u201d\u00a0meaning\u00a0compensation for deaths and injuries. putin didn\u2019t say how much was spent on wagner\u2019s equipment and ammunition, but the numbers he gave are revealing. advertisement for one, they appear to be insufficient for the group\u2019s reported size. in march, the uk defense ministryestimated\u00a0wagner had , fighters in ukraine.\u00a0prigozhin himself said in may that he had\u00a0, fighters\u00a0on the front lines. in addition,\u00a0he was allowed to recruit , convicts from prison camps. according to prigozhin,of the former prisoners\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that is, about , \u2014 and an equal number of mercenaries\u00a0were killed in action. some\u00a0 of both groups were wounded and unable to keep fighting. prigozhin\u2019s estimates suggest that, on average, some , mercenaries and some , convicts were fighting for wagner at any given moment. if putin\u2019s figures are correct, each\u00a0of the , fighters received about , rubles\u00a0, a month. that\u2019s less than even the , rubles that convicts werepromised by wagner, not to mention\u00a0the\u00a0minimum salaries of , rubles and monthly bonuses of , rubles offered to volunteers at the private military company\u2019s\u00a0recruitment offices throughout russia.\u00a0 meanwhile, the \u201cinsurance\u201d\u00a0payments are closer to prigozhin\u2019s assessment of about , dead and , badly wounded. wagnerpaid between\u00a0. million rubles and . million rubles to the family of a fallen mercenary or convict and between , rubles andmillion rubles for a severe\u00a0injury.\u00a0putin\u2019s . billion rubles for \u201cinsurance\u201d\u00a0would have meant an average of . million rubles per casualty. advertisement in other words, if putin\u2019s spending numbers are correct, it\u2019s likely that prigozhin overstated the size of his army. indeed,\u00a0it would be in his interest to do so, inflating wagner\u2019s importance as the defense ministry sought to disband the group. but prigozhin\u00a0didn\u2019t seem to stray too far from the truth on casualties as he highlighted the heavy price his mercenary army paid for the relatively insignificant victories at the towns of soledar and bakhmut. this would partially explain the failure of the mutiny: prigozhin\u2019s force was decimated by the losses from urban fighting in ukraine, so only a few thousand fighters could move on moscow while a few thousand more patrolled the center of rostov on june . if no more than , wagner soldiers \u2014\u00a0, professionals and , convictsfought in ukraine in any given month, it\u2019s clear\u00a0where the money went and why so little was required. the defense ministry\u2019s math looks murkier. its\u00a0contract soldiers are supposed to receive a onetime signon bonus of , rubles and a minimum of , rubles a month afterwards. at some , rubles\u00a0per month, a russian military force of , in ukraine uk defense ministryestimate would cost somebillion rubles per year, not counting payments to wounded vets and families. that is a mereof the russia\u2019s defense ministry\u2019s . trillion ruble budget allocation for the\u00a0russian armed forces in , which only includes direct spending on maintaining russia\u2019s main fighting force and none of the funding set aside for other armed units such as the rosgvardia national guard, also present in ukraine. the total russian defense and security budget inis expected to reach . trillion rubles. advertisement no nato country spends less thanof its defense budget on personnel. turkey\u2019s personnel expenses hover near\u00a0half of its military budget, and the us, which is usually at war somewhere, pays out betweenandfor its service members. according to sipri, classified \u201cnational defense\u201d spending reachedtrillion rubles between jan.\u00a0 and may\u2014\u00a0someof the classified spending budgeted for the entire year, which is not unusual since defense industry contractors\u2019 payments tend to be weighted heavily toward the first months of the year. it\u2019s not as if the defense ministry lacks the money to pay soldiers regularly and almost as well as prigozhin paid his supposedly elite force. and yet\u00a0service members and their families\u00a0 regularlycomplain of lapsed payments. unlike wagner fighters, mobilized and volunteer soldiers often have to buy their own equipment or rely on supplies from volunteer groups.\u00a0 the\u00a0kremlin is happy that it\u2019s able to keep military spending under control,\u00a0but even the existing outlay allows for plenty of inefficiency and corruption. that\u2019s the part visible to the soldiers and officers on the ground; after putin publicly named wagner\u2019s costs, wagner\u2019s legend of deadly efficiency can only grow in comparison with what regular soldiers know about the defense ministry\u2019s practices. wagner\u2019s death rate, shown by the same numbers to be higher than prigozhin had let on, likely will not affect that legend or damp the anger among russian service members \u2014\u00a0if only because both the\u00a0mercenaries and the convicts knew what they were in for when they signed up for wagner.\u00a0 advertisement it\u2019s much harder for the regular military\u00a0to riot than it was for prigozhin\u2019s mercenaries.

ready for ukraine to join in a historic step that could deter moscow but that might also increase the risk of a usrussia war. biden has staked his foreign policy legacy on arming ukraine to repel the russian invasion \u2013 most recently with a contentious decision to sendcluster bombs . but he nevertheless sent a strong message to kyiv in anexclusive cnn interview that its increasingly sharp campaign is unlikely to result in a certain date for nato entry emerging from the alliance\u2019s summit in lithuania this week.while some eastern european alliance members are bullish on an early timetable to welcome ukraine, some firstgeneration states, including the us, are more cautious, partly due to fears that moving quickly on nato membership could provoke the direct conflict with russia that biden is desperate to avoid. president joe biden speaks with cnns fareed zakaria during a televised interview inside the roosevelt room at the white house in washington, on friday, july , .tom brenner for cnn cnn exclusive: biden says war with russia must end before nato can consider membership for ukraine \u201ci don\u2019t think there is unanimity in nato about whether or not to bring ukraine into the nato family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war,\u201d biden said in an interview with cnn\u2019s fareed zakaria broadcast on sunday. the president said that the alliance

comments will disappoint ukraine as it suffers through a horrific war that has seen multiple crimes against humanity. ukraine has often warned it is fighting the west\u2019s war against russian

deterring kremlin aggression. critics of enlargement into formerly soviet eastern europe, however, argue the process humiliated moscow, turned it back into an avowed foe of the west and helped lead to the invasion of ukraine. a decision to admit ukraine would extend the sacred nato pledge that an attack on one member is an attack on all to a nation russia regards, at a minimum, as part of its

only through nato membership that ukraine can experience true security in the face of repeated russian aggression,\u201d the senators said in a statement. \u201ctheir fight has been a stand against

russia\u2019s threat \u2013 would change the strategic picture in western europe. they would also be made with no guarantee that the kremlin would become more benign toward the west in future decades. but there is no reason, for example, why the us and its allies cannot make a commitment to offer ukraine the means to defend itself \u2013 short of nato membership \u2013 much as the us does with israel and taiwan. the risk of a clash with russia in the future weighs heavily on the minds of many analysts. \u201cthe united states should not guarantee ukrainian security. period,\u201d said ben friedman, policy director at defense priorities, a think tank dedicated to promoting a realist vision of national security policy. \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t do so now, via nato or otherwise through some sort of bilateral security guarantees, and we shouldn\u2019t do so as part of a peace deal.\u201dfriedman argued that despite ukraine\u2019s heroic resistance, wider considerations of washington\u2019s interests must take priority. \u201cguaranteeing ukraine\u2019s security would erode us security by increasingly the risk, obviously, of war with russia,\u201d he said. \u201cthat contains the risk, of course, of nuclear escalation, and for that risk i think the united states receives basically nothing of security value.\u201d neither biden, nor any other member of his administration have made a case to the american people as to why ultimately it would be in the interest ofmillion americans to go to war with moscow to defend ukraine if it joined nato. in fact, the president has made an opposite, implicit case, stressing that despite a proxywar type situation in ukraine, his core concern is avoiding a direct clash with russia. advocates of nato welcoming ukraine often argue that no such undertaking was secured from american voters regarding other formally communist eastern european states once in the soviet union\u2019s orbit. but ukraine could be more at risk since it carries greater cultural and historical associations \u2013 and, for russia, it is linked to its selfidentity, whether justified or not. one potential downfall of offering ukraine eventual security guarantees through nato or another mechanism would be if political will to enforce them ebbs in future. a failure to defend such guarantees would raise grave doubts about nato\u2019s existing mutual defense ethos and could end up disastrously weakening the integrity of the alliance.even if biden were to amend his position on accelerating nato membership for ukraine, he cannot ensure a successor would honor treaty obligations. indeed, expresident donald trump has been loudly warning that biden is leading the us into a potential world war iii against russia, and he has insisted he\u2019d end the war in ukraine withinhours if elected to a new term. such comments suggest more sympathy to the goals of putin, to whom he has often cozied up.the uncertain political situation in the us may be one reason why zelensky has appeared so desperate to ensure his country\u2019s urgent nato aspirations are set in stone at this week\u2019s summit.",

relentless bombardment of kyiv with a third assault on the cityinhours the russian defense ministry said five drones were shot down in moscow and the systems of three others were jammed, causing them to veer off course. it called the incident a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d by the \u201ckyiv regime.\u201d read more: russia issues arrest warrant for lindsey graham over comments on war in ukraine the attack, causing only what moscow mayor sergei sobyanin called \u201cinsignificant damage\u201d to several buildings, brought the war home to civilians in russia\u2019s capital. two people received treatment for unspecified injuries but did not need hospitalization, he said in a telegram post, adding that residents of two highrise buildings damaged in the attack were evacuated. andrei vorobyov, governor of the wider moscow region, said some of the drones were \u201cshot down on the approach to moscow.\u201d ukraine made no direct comment on the attack, which would be one of its deepest and most daring strikes into russia since the kremlin launched itsfullscale invasion of ukraine more thanmonths ago. russian president vladimir putin started work early on tuesday to receive information about the drone attack from various government agencies, but did not plan to address the nation in the wake of the assault, kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters. asked by the associated press whether there is concern in the kremlin that the invasion of ukraine is endangering russian civilians, peskov said only that attacks on russia reinforce the need to prosecute the war. read more:

afraid, and everything is built on the idea that has been voiced more than once about a patient people who will understand everything and endure everything.\u201d still, the attacks raised questions about the effectiveness of russia\u2019s air defense systems. a senior russian lawmaker, andrei kartapolov, told russian business news site rbc that \u201cwe have a very big country and there will always be a loophole where the drone can fly around the areas where air defense systems are located.\u201d kartapolov said the purpose of the attacks was to unnerve the russian people. \u201cit\u2019s an intimidation act aimed at the civilian population,\u201d rbc quoted him as saying. \u201cit\u2019s designed to create a wave of panic.\u201d moscow residents reported hearing explosions before dawn. police were seen working at one site of a crashed drone in southwest moscow. an area near a residential building was fenced off, and police put the drone debris in a cardboard box before carrying it away. at another site, apartment windows were shattered and there were scorch marks on the building\u2019s front. it was the second reported attack on moscow. russian authorities said two drones targeted the kremlin on mayin what they portrayed as an attempt on putin\u2019s life. ukraine denied it was behind that attack. watch: a look at the man running mercenary wagner group in

paramilitary groups claiming responsibility. officials in the southern russian city of krasnodar near annexed crimea said two drones struck there on friday, damaging residential buildings. other drones have reportedly flown deep into russia multiple times. in december,russia claimed it had shot down drones at airfields in the saratov and ryazan regions in western russia. three soldiers were reported killed in the attack in saratov, which targeted an important military airfield. before that, russia reported downing a drone that targeted the headquarters of its black sea fleet in the crimean port of sevastopol. in ukraine, russia launched a predawn air raid on kyiv, killing at least one person and sending the capital\u2019s residents again scrambling into shelters. ukrainian military analysts, though unable to confirm that kyiv had launched the drones against moscow, said the attack may have involved uj drones with a maximum range of about , kilometersmiles and are produced in ukraine. analyst oleh zhdanov said some ujs are capable of reaching \u201cmoscow and beyond,\u201d although he noted they can fly only half as far and carry half the payload of the

a building where apartments were wrecked; in moscow, only a few broken windows and scorched outer walls were evident, with repairs and repainting being done quickly to the affected buildings. a woman

video footage showed a massive breach in the dam, with water surging through it and flooding downstream in the direction of kherson.ukrainian dam operator ukrhydroenerho said the nova kakhovka station was quot;fully destroyedquot; and could not be restored. itx;s unclear when exactly the dam was first damaged, but satellite images suggest its condition deteriorated over a number of days.as water from the vast kakhovka reservoir poured through the damaged dam, agricultural land and dozens of villages and towns were quickly flooded. thousands of people from both sides of the river have been evacuated from their homes, but the full scale of the disaster is not yet clear.satellite images reveal scale of dam tragedy there are also major environmental concerns. the river has been contaminated withtonnes of industrial lubricant, said president volodymyr zelensky, and anothertonnes was at risk of leaking. agricultural land has been washed away and the consequences of the flooding on local farmland is likely to be felt for years. landmines are also being dislodged by the floodwaters, prompting concerns not just for residents in kherson, but also those coming to provide assistance.president zelensky visited the floodhit region on thursday and said the priority was to quot;protect lives and help people as much as possiblequot;.he also visited a crossing point in the city where people were being evacuated from the flooded area and a medical facility.has the dam been attacked? itx;s not yet clear what caused the breach in the dam, but ukrainex;s military has accused russia of deliberately blowing it up. moscow may have feared that ukrainian forces would use the road over the dam to get troops across the river into russianheld territory, as part of a counteroffensive. mykola kalinin, chief engineer at a hydropower and water management engineering company in ukraine, ukrhydroproject, claimed that an explosion was the cause.the dam, he told ukrainian data journalism site texty, was quot;built to withstand a superpowerful impact from the outsidequot;. mr kalinin concludes that it was mined from the inside. but kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov blamed ukraine, calling it an act of quot;sabotagequot; that would deprive the crimean peninsulaan area annexed by russia inof water.neither ukraine nor russiax;s claims have been verified by the bbc.alternative theories of what could have caused, or at least contributed, to the breaching of the dam have been put forward. fighting in the area could have affected the structure, mark mulligan, professor of physical geography at university college london, told the bbc. a second theory he put forward was that russia, which controls the dam, deliberately allowed water levels to rise in the reservoir behind itmaking a collapse more likely and more impactful. according to analysis of satellite imagery carried out by theus foreign agricultural service , water levels rose sharply over the last few months. however, the damx;s destruction is hard to assess on satellite imagery alone, as much of the damage is underwater. mr zelensky has accused the international community of not reacting fast enough to the flooding, and said without drinking water, food or medicine it was impossible to know how many people would die.he has accused international organisations, like the red cross, of losing the ability to save lives. the world bank has offered to conduct a rapid assessment of the damage and ukrainex;s most urgent needs. what was the purpose of the dam? it held back a vast reservoir that supplied water to communities upstream, and provided cooling water to the nuclear power station at zaporizhzhia, around kmmiles away, which is under russian control. the international atomic energy agency iaea said there was no immediate nuclear safety risk but it was monitoring the situation. it later said that if the dam did fall below .m, the lowest level at which water can still be pumped upstream to zaporizhzhia, there were alternative water sources to keep the nuclear plant cool. the dam was also a vital channel carrying water from the river to russianoccupied crimea, meaning water supplies there are likely to be affected. after russia annexed crimea in , ukraine blocked a channel carrying water from nova kakhovka, triggering a water crisis on the peninsula. russian forces reopened the channel after last yearx;s invasion. but without the dam, dropping water levels could once again jeopardise the flow of water along the channel. russia has previously carried out several attacks on dams throughout ukraine since the invasion, causing widespread flooding and disrupting power supplies.",

president volodymyr zelensky delivered a historic speech from the united states capitol wednesday night, expressing gratitude for american support in fighting russian aggression since the war began \u2013 and asking for more. \u201ci hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each american heart,\u201d zelensky said during the joint meeting of congress, later adding, \u201cagainst all odds, and doom and gloom scenarios, ukraine didn\u2019t fall. ukraine is alive and kicking.\u201dbut alongside zelensky\u2019s gratitude was a plea, emphasizing that his armed forces are outnumbered and outgunned by the russian military even as they fight on. at one point, zelensky drew laughs from the chamber when he said, \u201cwe have artillery, yes. thank you. we have it. is it enough? honestly, not really.\u201d zelensky\u2019s visit to washington marks his first trip outside hishomeland since it was invadeddays ago, arriving wednesday afternoon to set a course for the future of the war alongside a key western ally.on \u201cthe frontline of tyranny,\u201d zelensky argued during his speech to congress, american support \u201cis crucial not just to stand in such a fight but to get to the turning point to win on the battlefield.\u201d \u201cthe world is too interconnected and too interdependent to allow someone to stay aside and at the same time to feel safe when such a battle continues,\u201d he added. \u201cour two nations are allies in this battle and next year will be a turning point, i know it \u2013 the point where ukrainian courage and american resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values.\u201d\u201cyour money is not charity,\u201d he asserted to congress. \u201cit\u2019s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.\u201d zelensky also called on lawmakers to strengthen sanctions against russia.still, despite that disparity in resources, zelensky said, \u201cukraine holds its line and will never surrender.\u201d in his speech, zelensky harkened back to american history, referencing the battle of the bulge, president franklin d. roosevelt and the battle of saratoga. just like \u201cbrave american soldiers which held their lines\u201d and fought against adolf hitler\u2019s nazi germany in , ukrainian soldiers \u201care doing the same to putin\u2019s forces this christmas,\u201d zelensky said. he also briefly discussed a point peace formula and summit that he told us president joe biden about during an earlier meeting at the white house. zelensky claimed biden supported the peace initiatives.zelensky also recalled his recent visit to the frontlines \u2013 bakhmut in donbas \u2013 which has been under siege since may. there, he said, \u201cevery inch of that land is soaked in blood, roaring guns sound every hour.\u201d in the climatic moment of the speech, he unveiled a ukrainian flag signed by soldiers fighting in bakhmut that he gave as a gift to the congress. \u201cthe occupiers have a significant advantage in artillery. they have an advantage in ammunition. they have much more missiles and planes than we ever have. it\u2019s true, but our defense forces stand,\u201d he added. russia, zelensky argued in strong terms, has \u201cfound an ally\u201d in iran.\u201ciran\u2019s deadly drones sent to russia in hundreds became a threat to our critical infrastructure. that is how one terrorist has found the other,\u201d he said. \u201cit is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies if we do not stop them now.\u201d zelensky\u2019s white house visit earlier wednesday the ukrainian leader visited the white house, where he met with biden and held a joint news conference, during which the duo displayed a united front on their approach to the war. \u201ci think \u2026 we share the exact same vision, and that a free, independent, prosperous and secure ukraine is the vision \u2013 we both want this war to end,\u201d biden told reporters in the white house east room. at the start of the news conference, biden relayed that he felt it was \u201cparticularly meaningful\u201d to speak to zelensky in person and \u201clook each other in the eye.\u201d the ukrainian president\u2019s leadership, biden said, has inspired the world.\u201cwe understand in our bones that ukraine\u2019s fight is part of something much bigger,\u201d biden continued.biden said zelensky has shown his \u201cstrong stand against aggression in the face of the imperial appetites of autocrats,\u201d and said the us was standing alongside ukraine in maintaining \u201ccore principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d both biden and zelensky addressed the russians during the news conference, with the ukranian president repeatedly calling russian forces \u201cterrorists\u201d and biden underscoring the importance of being \u201cclear\u201d about russia\u2019s actions.\u201cit is purposely attacking ukraine critical infrastructure, destroying the system to provide heat and light to ukrainian people during the coldest, darkest part of the year. russia is using winter as a weapon, freezing people, starving people, cutting them off from one another,\u201d biden said. the war, biden later argued, \u201ccould end today if putin had any dignity at all and did the right thing and just \u2026 pulled out. but that\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201dbut the two leaders, it seems, still have different perspectives on their approach to pursuing peace with russia.early in the news conference, biden said zelensky was open to pursuing a \u201cjust peace.\u201d later, when asked by a reporter to share his idea of a fair way to end the war, the ukrainian leader responded, \u201cfor me, as a president, just peace is no compromises as to the sovereignty, freedom and territorial integrity of my country, the payback for all the damages inflicted by russian aggression.\u201d\u201cthere can\u2019t be any just peace in the war that was imposed on us by these \u2026 inhumans, i would say,\u201d he added.meeting comes at a critical moment president

in ukraine, in europe, in the world, from energy to the situation on the battlefield,\u201d zelensky said in the oval office. \u201cbut first of all, really, all my appreciations from my heart, from the heart of ukrainians, all ukrainians, from our nation.\u201d ukraines president volodymyr zelenskiy visits ukrainian service members at their position in the frontline town of bakhmut, amid russias attack on ukraine, in donetsk region, ukraine december , . ukrainian presidential press servicehandout via reuters attention editorsthis image has been supplied by a third party. ukrainian presidential press servicereuters analysis: why zelenskyx;s surprise us visit is so hugely significant the wartime visit was meant to demonstrate in stirring fashion the continued american commitment to ukraine at a moment when biden\u2019s ability to maintain that support at home and abroad is being tested. it has also been an opportunity for biden and top american officials to sound out zelensky on how he views the trajectory of the conflict, and to offer their thoughts on what it would take to bring the war to an end. \u201ctogether with our partners,\u00a0we\u2019re also going to impose costs\u00a0on the kremlin and will support\u00a0ukraine in pursuing a just\u00a0peace,\u201d biden said in the oval office, a reference to how zelensky has said he hopes to see the war end. \u201cpresident zelensky, the\u00a0united states stands with the\u00a0brave people in ukraine.\u201d sitting before a roaring fireplace, zelensky offered biden a military cross medal from a ukrainian soldier serving on the front lines.\u201che said, \u2018give it to a very brave president,\u2019\u201d zelensky said. \u201cundeserved but much appreciated,\u201d biden replied as he accepted the medal, asking if it would be possible to contact the ukrainian soldier. a surprise visit the trip, which us and ukrainian officials arranged in secret over the past week, came with heavy risks. after arriving in poland by train, zelensky flew to washington aboard an american military aircraft, us officials said. he arrived in the us shortly after midday at joint base andrews, just outside the nation\u2019s capital. brendan smialowskiafpgetty images biden first discussed the prospect of zelensky visiting washington during a telephone call with the ukrainian leader on december , an administration official said. a formal invitation was extended a week ago that zelensky accepted, launching joint consultations on the security parameters of the risky, highly secretive trip. zelensky, who the official said was \u201cvery keen\u201d to visit the us, determined those parameters met his needs, and the us set to work executing them. the trip was finally confirmed on sunday.tight security was enforced around zelensky\u2019s visit amid concerns that russia wants to incapacitate the ukrainian president, a source close to the ukrainian leader told cnn on wednesday. because of this ongoing threat, senior top government officials \u2013 as well as embassy staff in the us \u2013 were not informed about the schedule of the visit. according to the source, the military risk had to be calculated allowing the ukrainian president to make the short overseas trip without jeopardizing the military situation. scheduling also had to be worked with the white house to assess availability for this to happen. in weighing a visit, zelensky suggested he did not want to travel had there not been a significant development in the bilateral relationship between ukraine and the us. zelensky viewed the us decision to send patriot missile defense systems to ukraine as a major shift in the relationship between the two allies. the new, . billion package biden unveiled includes a patriot surfacetoair missile system, which has been a longstanding request of ukraine\u2019s to fend of russian air attacks.cnn was first to report the us was expected to send the patriot systems to ukraine. unlike smaller air defense systems, patriot missile batteries need much larger crews, requiring dozens of personnel to properly operate them. the training for patriot missile batteries normally takes multiple months, a process the united states will now carry out under the pressure of neardaily aerial attacks from russia. the system is widely considered one of the most capable longrange weapons to defend airspace against incoming ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as some aircraft. because of its longrange and highaltitude capability, it can potentially shoot down russian missiles and aircraft far from their intended targets inside ukraine. during the news conference, biden told cnn\u2019s phil mattingly that the missile system is defensive, not escalatory. zelensky said the system is \u201csomething that will strengthen our air defense significantly.\u201d \u201cevery dollar of this investment for the united states is going to be a strengthening of global security and i know that the american leadership will be strong and will play important role in global scope,\u201d zelensky added.he also suggested ukraine would want more of the systems.",

moment when biden\u2019s ability to maintain that support at home and abroad is being tested it has also been an opportunity for biden and top american officials to sound out zelensky on how he views the trajectory of the conflict and to offer their thoughts on what it would take to bring the war to an end \u201ctogether with our partners we\u2019re also going to impose costs\u00a0on the kremlin

keen\u201d to visit the us determined those parameters met his needs and the us set to work executing them the trip was finally confirmed on sunday tight security was enforced around zelensky\u2019s visit amid concerns that russia wants to incapacitate the ukrainian president a source close to the ukrainian leader told cnn on wednesday because of this ongoing threat senior top government officials \u2013 as well as embassy staff in the us \u2013 were not informed about the schedule of the visit according to the source the military risk had to be calculated allowing the ukrainian president to make the short overseas trip without jeopardizing the military situation scheduling also had to be worked with the white house to assess availability for this to happen in weighing a visit zelensky suggested he did not want to travel had there not been a significant development in the bilateral relationship between ukraine and the us zelensky viewed the us decision to send patriot missile defense systems to ukraine as a major shift in the relationship between the two allies the new  billion package biden unveiled includes a patriot surfacetoair missile system which has been a longstanding request of ukraine\u2019s to fend of russian air attacks cnn was first to report the us was expected to send the patriot systems to ukraine unlike smaller air defense systems patriot missile batteries need much larger crews requiring dozens of personnel to properly operate them the training for patriot missile batteries normally takes multiple months a process the united states will now carry out under the pressure of neardaily aerial attacks from russia the system is widely considered one of the most capable longrange weapons to defend airspace against incoming ballistic and cruise missiles as well as some aircraft because of its longrange and highaltitude capability it can potentially shoot down russian missiles and aircraft far from their intended targets inside ukraine during the news conference biden told cnn\u2019s phil mattingly that the missile system is defensive not escalatory zelensky said the system is \u201csomething that will strengthen our air defense significantly \u201d \u201cevery dollar of this investment for the united states is going to be a strengthening of global security and i know that the american leadership will be strong and will play important role in global scope \u201d zelensky added he also suggested ukraine would want more of the systems  "

near some of the fiercest fighting and others where his country\u2019s forces have successfully repelled russia\u2019s invasion. zelenskyy rarely travels with journalists, and the president\u2019s office said ap\u2019s twonight train trip with him was the most extensivesince the war began since then, ukraine \u2014 backed by much of the west \u2014 has surprised the world with the strength of its resistance against the larger, betterequipped russian military. ukrainian forces haveheld their capital, kyiv , and pushed russia back from other strategically important areas.but as the war enters its second year, zelenskyy finds himself focused on keeping motivation high in both his military and the general ukrainian population \u2014 particularly the millions who have fled abroad and those living in relative comfort and security far from the front lines. zelenskyy is also well aware that his country\u2019s success has been in great part due to waves of international military support, particularly from the united states and western europe. but some in the united states \u2014 including republican donald trump, the former american president and currentcandidate \u2014 have questioned whether washington should continue to supply ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid.trump\u2019s likely republican rival, florida gov. ron desantis, also suggested that defending

could be impacted by shifting political forces in washington.\u201cthe united states really understands that if they stop helping us, we will not win,\u201d he said in the interview. he sipped tea as he sat on a narrow bed in the cramped, unadorned sleeper cabin on a state railway train. the president\u2019s carefully calibrated railroad trip was a remarkable journey across land through a country at war. zelenskyy, who has become a recognizable face across the world as he doggedly tells his side of the story to nation after nation, used the moralebuilding journey to carry his considerable clout to regions close to the front lines. he traveled with a small cadre of advisers and a large group of heavily armed security officials dressed in battlefield fatigues. his destinations included ceremonies marking the oneyear anniversary of the liberation of towns in the sumy region and visits with troops stationed at frontline positions near zaporizhzhia. each visit was kept under wraps until after he departed.zelenskyy recently made a similar visitnear bakhmut , where ukrainian and russian forces have been locked for months in a grinding and bloody battle. while some western

at risk. \u201cwe can\u2019t lose the steps because the war is a pie \u2014 pieces of victories. small victories, small steps,\u201d he said.zelensky\u2019s comments were an acknowledgement that losing the monthlong battle for bakhmut \u2014 the longest of the war thus far \u2014 would be more of a costly political defeat than a tactical one. he predicted that the pressure from a defeat in bakhmut would come quickly \u2014 both from the international community and within his own country. \u201cour society will feel tired,\u201d he said. \u201cour society will push me to have compromise with them.\u201d so far, zelenskyy says he hasn\u2019t felt that pressure. the international community has largely rallied around ukraine following russia\u2019s feb. , , invasion. in recent months, a parade of world leaders have visited zelenskyy in ukraine, most traveling in on trains similar to the ones the president uses to crisscross the country. in his ap interview, zelenskyy extended an invitation to ukraine to one notable and strategically important leader who has not made the journey \u2014 chinese president xi jinping.\u201cwe are ready to see him here,\u201d he said. \u201ci want

russia across many decades, has provided putin diplomatic cover by staking out an official position of neutrality in the war. asked whether xi would accept an invitation from zelenskyy \u2014 or whether one had been officially extended \u2014 chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman mao ning told reporters she had no information to give. she did say that beijing maintains \u201ccommunication with all parties concerned, including ukraine.\u201d dbadbbaebbfdd kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov, asked whether a meeting between xi and zelenskyy would be useful to resolve the conflict in ukraine, said

leader himself decides the appropriateness of certain contacts,\u201d peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters wednesday. xi visited putin in russia last week , raising the prospect that beijing might be ready to provide moscow with the weapons and ammunition it needs to refill its depleted stockpile. but xi\u2019s trip ended without any such announcement. days later, putin announced that he would be deploying tactical nuclear weapons to belarus, which neighbors russia and pushes the kremlin\u2019s nuclear stockpile closer to nato territory.zelenskyy suggested putin\u2019s move was intended to distract from the lack of guarantees he received from china.\u201cwhat does it mean? it means that the visit was not good for russia,\u201d zelenskyy speculated. he was unsparing in his assessment of putin, calling him an \u201cinformationally isolated person\u201d who had \u201clost everything\u201d over the last year of war. \u201che doesn\u2019t have

prevail through a series of \u201csmall victories\u201d and \u201csmall steps\u201d against a \u201cvery big country, big enemy, big army\u201d \u2014 but an army, he said, with \u201csmall

lives, she says.so why would putin use this particular language to justify an invasion now? lautman says putin has long mourned the collapse of the soviet union and has nothing to show despite having been in power for two decades.if hes able to reclaim some of this lost territory, on top of having a few satellite states, which hes been attempting to do over the past decade ... then at least he

there is no genocide not even an ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the ukraine against ethnic russians and russianspeakers in the ukraine it is a fiction that is used by putin to justify his war of

majority having very little interest in anything to do with them she said the u s probably has a higher percentage of white supremacist and nazi groups while casanova also says ukraine has a smaller
