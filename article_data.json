Гонения на священников УПЦ носят цивилизационный характер, заявил \"Парламентской газете\" депутат Госдумы Сергей Гаврилов накануне истечения срока пребывания монахов УПЦ в Киево-Печерской лавре.\"Выселение монахов из Киево-Печерской лавры – это борьба с верой, это цивилизационный конфликт\", – подчеркнул заместитель координатора межфракционной рабочей группы ГД по совершенствованию законодательства о защите христианских ценностей.Он рассказал, что, по его мнению, является основой этих гонений.\"Эти испытания, эти гонения, которые инициированы неонацистами не только в лавре, но и по всей Украине, сутью своей имеют борьбу неоязычества, лежащего в фундаменте охватившей киевскую власть бандеровщины, с православным христианством в целом\", – отмечает Гаврилов.По мнению парламентария, созданная киевскими властями псевдоправославная ПЦУ является не церковью, а политической партией, отстаивающей интересы нацистского \"электората\" на Украине.\"Мы можем увидеть массовые случаи насилия над священниками и монахами, массовое кровопролитие и репрессии в отношении тех верующих, которые считают себя частью канонической православной церкви\", – заключил депутат.Ранее радио Sputnik сообщило, что монахи Киево-Печерской лавры отказались выселяться."

С соответствующим предположением выступил отечественный политолог Сергей Марков. Марков полагает, что прокурор МУС Карим Ахмад Хан выписал ордер в обмен на досрочное освобождение из тюрьмы своего брата, Имрана Ахмад Хана. По версии Маркова, Карим Ахмад Хан может принадлежать к тому же &laquo;тайному клубу&raquo;, что и его брат.

Задачи демилитаризации и денацификации киевского режима ВС России решают планомерно и методично, со скоростью, обеспечивающей высокую эффективность и убедительный результат.Российские войска 11 января взяли под полный контроль город Соледар, расположенный в 6 км от Артемовска/Бахмута. Окруженный в центре Соледара гарнизон ВСУ (несколько подразделений 61-й пехотной, 46-й аэромобильной и 128-й горно-штурмовой бригад) рассечен на четыре сектора, которые нейтрализуются (уничтожаются) по отдельности силами ЧВК \"Вагнер\". Украинская \"военная элита\" предпочитает отсиживаться в системе солевых шахт и пещер протяженностью в 200 км или в подвалах многоквартирных домов – прикрываясь мирными жителями, как прежде делали морские пехотинцы ВСУ в Мариуполе.Днем ранее российские войска начали штурм Соледара с нескольких направлений. Главком ВСУ Валерий Залужный доложил руководству о критической ситуации, настаивал на выводе украинских подразделений из города, чтобы они избежали окружения. Одновременно в разных источниках появилась информация о массовом дезертирстве украинских войск в Соледаре. Подразделения ВСУ, отряды польских и британских наемников понесли здесь огромные, беспрецедентные потери, и это важнее территориальных обретений.Стратегический успех каждой серьезной войсковой операции измеряется в большей степени уничтожением армии противника, нежели квадратными километрами. В тот день, когда будет полностью разгромлена украинская армия, территориальный контроль в зоне СВО автоматически перейдет к победителю – ВС России. А пока специальная военная операция находится в развитии, и украинский гарнизон соседнего города Артемовск/Бахмут – в полукольце окружения, которое методично смыкается усилиями ВС России и ЧВК \"Вагнер\" (парадоксальные \"музыканты\" стали достойнейшей частью Вооруженных сил).Транспортные коммуникации блокированы – доставить резервы или вывести подразделения ВСУ на запад под огневым контролем российской артиллерии практически невозможно. В трех километрах южнее Артемовска/Бахмута продолжаются бои в селе Клещеевка, где сосредоточены последние на южном направлении оборонительные рубежи ВСУ.Рождественский прорывГлавком Валерий Залужный еще 6 января предложил президенту Украины Владимиру Зеленскому оставить Бахмут – \"точку сжигания резервов\", но в Киеве традиционно возобладало политическое безрассудство. Отказавшись от предложенного Москвой рождественского прекращения огня, киевский режим получил сокрушительные удары российских войск на линии боевого соприкосновения в Соледаре и Артемовске. Здесь разгромлены шесть бригад ВСУ, и все же удержать города \"любой ценой\" не удается.В Соледаре уничтожены или бежали даже самые подготовленные, идеологически мотивированные подразделения спецназа \"Карпаты\" и горно-штурмовых бригад. Статистика безвозвратных потерь ВСУ за семь суток боев в Соледаре и Артемовске – до двух тысяч убитых. Дальнейшее забрасывание украинских резервов в \"бахмутскую мясорубку\" не имеет смысла. Потеря оборонительных позиций на 30-километровой линии Артемовск – Соледар – Северск грозит ВСУ обвалом \"фронта\" (Краматорского оборонительного рубежа), и прочими неприятными последствиями (вероятно сокращение военной помощи Запада).Кроме того, активные действия российских войск и ЧВК \"Вагнер\" в Артемовске и Соледаре сорвали планы контрнаступления ВСУ на Мелитополь. Подразделения ВС Россиивыбили противника с нескольких опорных пунктов к западу от дороги Сватово-Кременная, и продолжают планомерно выдавливать украинских оккупантов с территории ЛНР и Донбасса в целом.Что касается безусловного огневого доминирования российских ракетных войск, артиллерии и РХБЗ, Минобороны РФ особо отмечает высокую эффективность тяжелых огнеметных систем ТОС-1А \"Солнцепек\". В зоне их боевого применения украинские националисты чаще добровольно сдаются в плен, оставляя позиции, игнорируя приказы своих командиров.Каждая новая волна массовой мобилизации приносит ВСУ все менее ценных солдат, не подготовленных физически и морально, не способных стойко сражаться и умирать за интересы США и нацистского киевского режима. Кадровый голод привел к массовому призыву в армию украинских женщин. На Харьковском направлении в радиоэфире все чаще слышна иностранная речь (преобладают \"добровольцы\" из Польши). В Киеве Зеленскому пришлось срочно формировать собственный \"гитлерюгенд\" из подростков 14 – 16 лет – сегодня несовершеннолетних \"солдат\" для ВСУ готовят неонацистские организации \"Пласт\", \"Правая молодежь\" и другие. Влиятельные западные издания, которые много месяцев пророчили скорую победу киевского режима, вынуждены замечать успехи российских войск в зоне СВО и признавать неизбежность поражения ВСУ.Подписывайтесь на канал военного обозревателя Александра Хроленко в Telegram"

Собеседник агентства напомнил, что имя Элизабет Дебрю фигурировало в&nbsp;признании бывшего сотрудника Службы безопасности Украины, рассказавшего о&nbsp;схеме изъятия органов украинских военнослужащих, погибших или смертельно раненных в&nbsp;Донбассе. По&nbsp;его словам, схема существовала уже в&nbsp;ноябре 2014 года, органы отправляли в&nbsp;западные страны, где хорошо развита трансплантология, в&nbsp;частности в&nbsp;Германию, а&nbsp;также в&nbsp;Израиль. По&nbsp;словам экс-сотрудника СБУ, эту операцию курировал украинский полковник  Мищенко , его подчиненные имели доступ к&nbsp;местам хранения тел погибших и&nbsp;к&nbsp;смертельно раненным. А&nbsp;командовала изъятием органов голландка Дебрю, при этом часто сама могла провести такую операцию. Официально СБУ опровергала эту информацию.

Тема &laquo;черной трансплантологии&raquo; действительно звучала еще в&nbsp;первые месяцы конфликта в&nbsp;Донбассе, правда, тогда число жертв было несоизмеримо меньше. Очевидно, рост ожесточения боевых действий вновь поманил &laquo;черных трансплатологов&raquo; на&nbsp;Украину.

Киев не заинтересован в мирном урегулировании конфликта на Украине, поскольку целая команда во главе с Владимиром Зеленским отмывает деньги, выделяемые на помощь Киеву, считает обозреватель телеканала Fox News Тодд Вуд.\"На Украине существует команда по отмыванию денег. Мы оценили, что только 30 процентов от заявленной гуманитарной помощи и оружия достигают цели. &amp;lt;…&amp;gt; Значительная их часть утекает за границу, мы говорим о приобретении недвижимости. По информации из проверенных источников мы знаем, что многие украинские чиновники купили дома в других странах\", – рассказал Вуд.Киеву не нужно мирное урегулирование кризиса, их устраивает такой способ заработка в кооперации с американскими оборонными предприятиями, отметил обозреватель.Вуд надеется, что денежный поток на Украину прекратится, как только контроль над палатой представителей перейдет к республиканцам, отмечает РИА Новости.Ранее радио Sputnik сообщило, что все больше республиканцев выступают против помощи Киеву."

      "Text": "Украинский нацизм – гремучая смесь язычества и сатанизма Каковы природа и облик современного украинского нацизма? И политическое, нравственное завещание. Предательство невозможно. &quot;При всех этих условиях Россия ни в какой форме не смеет равнодушно предать многомиллионное русское население на Украине, отречься от нашего единства с ним&quot;, &ndash; подчеркивал писатель. Вот это и есть  денацификация с прикладной точки зрения. Денацификация &ndash; это когда остатки костяка полка &quot;Азов&quot; прячутся, прикрывшись заложниками в подвалах завода &quot;Азовсталь&quot;. Когда недобитые нацисты просят выпустить их в Турцию или дать им гуманитарный коридор. Денацификация &ndash; это когда неонацисты из полка &quot;Азов&quot; заживо гниют в холодных заводских подвалах. А тела других нацистов гниют на уничтоженных позициях. Это те самые нацисты, которые когда-то наводили ужас на жителей юго-востока. Война с нацизмом не абстрактная вещь, не лозунг. Это то, что успешно делает сегодня русская армия. И вроде было принято восклицать у определенной публики: ну, какие там на Украине нацисты!? Так вот же они. Те, кто носят на шевронах знаки различия эсэсовской дивизии. Те, у кого этот же символ &ndash; на воротах бывшей базы &quot;Азова&quot;, где теперь снимает репортаж наш коллега. И набор литературы тоже соответствующий. Про отважных фашистов, героических бандеровцев, Муссолини. Впрочем, сегодня понятие денацификация распространяется не только на неонацистские подразделения. Но и на большую часть украинской армии. Во всяком случае в Луганской или Донецкой республиках уже давно никто серьезных различий не видит. Вот трофеи с базы &quot;Азова&quot;, добыли их бойцы ДНР. Флаг со свастикой, шевроны со свастиками и рунами, опять книги и диски про Гитлера и Бандеру. Но, в принципе, вот эту всю атрибутику можно найти практически в любом подразделении ВСУ. Понятно, что не за год и два, даже не за восемь постмайданных лет Украина пропиталась нацистской идеологией. Началось это, конечно, еще в 80-х, когда разваливался СССР и Украина обрела независимость. Новому государству срочно требовалась некая национальная идея. Надо же было как-то объяснять, почему вчерашние идейные, казалось бы, коммунисты, теперь стали национальными лидерами. В украинском изводе идея звучала предельно просто: мы &ndash; это не Россия. Во всех бедах и проблемах Украины виновата тоже Россия. С первых же дней независимости, идеология строилась на фундаменте украинского нацизма, а иначе было невозможно ни разорвать традиционные связи с Россией, ни оторвать Украину от русской цивилизации и культуры. По большому счету, выходцы из КПСС и действовали-то как большевики. Те &ndash; когда создавали советского человека, украинские власти &ndash; свидомого громодянина, совершенного украинца. И базой для этого стали школьники и студенты. Книги отцов украинского национализма печатались многотысячными тиражами. При Кучме, при Ющенко, при Януковиче. На русском ли, на украинском. Бандеровцы и Бандера постепенно героизировались. Активно в этом участие принимали украинские диаспоры из Канады и США. Это как если бы в России в 90-е за воспитание молодежи и идеологию отвечали бы бывшие власовцы и полицаи. Надо справедливости ради сказать, что мы в это едва не свалились, удержались. А вот Украина нет. Кроме того, была еще одна причина, почему нацистские идеи становились популярнее год от года. Как ни странно, но в первую очередь даже не на Западе Украины, а на юге и юго-востоке. Деиндустриализация 90-х и нулевых. Заводы &ndash; открытые еще в царское или советское время &ndash; закрывались, отцы теряли работу, детям было легко объяснять, что во всем виноваты москали. И вот поэтому в русском вроде бы Харькове была самая мощная структура &quot;Правого сектора&quot; (запрещена в РФ). А в Днепропетровске формировали &quot;Азов&quot;. Кстати, кго лидер Андрей Белецкий закончил Харьковский университет. Дипломную работу в 2001 году посвятил истории Украинской повстанческой армии (запрещена в РФ), то есть бандеровских боевиков. Вот так постепенно идеи легализовывались и внедрялись в массы. Вообще на Украине уже десять лет назад считалось нормальным и одобрять нацизм, и просто шутить вокруг него. Просто пример. В пятницу с &quot;Азовстали&quot; вышла семья. Гражданские. Заложники. Стали проверять &ndash; и вот отец семейства, обычный рабочий, в 2012 году сделал фото с железным крестом, с нацистским приветствием. Проверили &ndash; нет, все же не боевик &quot;Азова&quot;. А фото сделал по глупости. Но атмосфера политическая такая, что фото с железным крестом &ndash; это нормально. И вообще Бандера &ndash; герой. Бандеровцы &ndash; борцы за свободу. Вермахт &ndash; освободители. Так про все рассказывали. Безусловно, за всеми ультраправыми, неонацистскими, необандеровскими партиями и движениями стояли серьезные люди. Высшие политики, крупные олигархи. Нацисты были их ресурсом и боевым отрядом. На Майдане именно они являлись ударной силой. И потом именно из них и примкнувших к неонацистам футбольных фанатов формировались первые территориальные батальоны. Проще, каратели. Неонацисты, идейные романтики Майдана, маргиналы, авантюристы, просто бандиты &ndash; адское варево, плавильный котел, из которого вылезли самые лютые, самые жестокие нацбатальоны: &quot;Днепр&quot;, &quot;Торнадо&quot;, &quot;Айдар&quot;, &quot;Азов&quot;. Но все равно объединяющей идеей была для них именно нацистская идея. Идея расового превосходства. И украинцев над русскими. И правильных украинцев, то ест националистов, над неправильными. Как когда-то СС в Германии создавалась по принципу этакого Рыцарского ордена, так и &quot;Азов&quot;, и прочие скопировали эту схему. Нацисты &ndash; как рыцари расовой борьбы, которые несут свет национального сознания. А нести его можно как угодно &ndash; хоть пытками, хоть убийством. Дело-то важное. Эта ситуация привлекала в карательные батальоны множество тех, кто просто не мог реализоваться в жизни. Или люди с низким уровнем образования, пониженным моральным порогом, лентяи и бездельники в конце-концов. А так пришел в &quot;Азов&quot; &ndash; и ты уже не абы кто, а &quot;воин света&quot;. Со свастикой, набитой во всю спину. И можно все. Пытать, убивать, чем собственно и отличались неонацисты. Вот пример. Боевик-нацист, попавший в плен. Татуировки: концлагерь Маутхаузен на животе, солдаты СС, нацистский железный крест на ноге, руна Одал &ndash; знак сотрудников Главного управления СС по вопросам расы. А теперь представьте, что таких &ndash; сотни! И все с оружием. И считаются официальным военным подразделением. Большое количество националистов, пройдя обкатку в карательных батальонах, отправлялось в армию, принося туда свою идеологию. И так 8 лет. Но и армия все 8 лет тоже, надо это понимать, не в казармах сидела. Взять обстрелы Луганска и Донецка. Что, военные не понимали, куда стреляют? Понимали. Но им же объяснили, что там сидят неправильные люди, москали и сепаратисты, которых и убить не жалко. Потому что только они мешают жить Украине. И ложится это все на знания, полученные за школьной партой. Так что не нужно иллюзий. По большому счету, вся группировка ВСУ на востоке Украины &ndash; десантники, морпехи, артиллеристы &ndash; это и есть самые идейные, самые мотивированные, самые идеологические накачанные нацисты.

What's behind the failure? 2023-06-13T18:18+0000 2023-06-13T18:18+0000 2023-06-13T18:28+0000 russia's special operation in ukraine us ukraine kiev russia antony blinken nato russian ministry of defense leopard 2 \"I would say that the counteroffensive is less than what [the West] expect[s],\" Michael Maloof, former senior security policy analyst in the US Office of the Secretary of Defense, told Sputnik. \"The extent to which the Ukrainians are undertaking any so-called counteroffensive is more of a probing action than an actual assault and onslaught.\"Per Maloof, the failure could be largely attributed to poor planning, lack of manpower, resources and training.Western Wonder-Weapons Bite the DustThe Ukrainian military has so far failed in all directions of their counteroffensive, despite receiving billions of dollars' worth of military equipment from the US and its NATO allies. In the first week alone, the Kiev regime forces lost thousands of casualties, along with more than a dozen of German Leopard 2 tanks, nearly two dozen of US-made Bradley infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) and several French AMX-10 RC light tanks. The pictures of destroyed Western military equipment have already been circulated by the media and social networks.The Russian armed forced has destroyed a vast amount of Ukraine's military equipment since day one of the special military operation, including: 442 airplanes and 238 helicopters, 4,585 unmanned aerial vehicles, 426 air defence missile systems, 9,939 tanks and other armoured combat vehicles, 1,122 combat vehicles equipped with MRLS, 5,100 field artillery cannons and mortars, as well as 10,927 units of special military equipment, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense.Matviychuk has drawn attention to the fact that the Russian military has repeatedly participated in local conflicts and peace missions starting from 1979. Therefore, despite all the shortcomings of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian military equipment has undergone development and is up to date in terms of modern warfare challenges. He placed special emphasis on maneuverability flaws of Western armored vehicles. Per him, the Eastern European military theater with its freeze, river floods, mud, swamps and other critical weather conditions became a serious challenge for the NATO military equipment. The Ukrainian military has faced a plethora of logistic problems including that the German 60-ton battle tanks could not cross some of Ukraine's bridges.Europe and the world have suddenly realized that Western-style equipment is not \"second to none\" in many respects, that it has its own shortcomings, along with its advantages, according to the military analyst.How Could Kiev's Failures Affect Weapons Supplies?Russia's relatively rapid obliteration of Western weapons and lack of any tangible victories on the front could affect weapons supplies, according to Sputnik's interlocutors.Kiev politicians have already urged their Western patrons to provide even more military equipment and armored vehicles to replace those destroyed. \"Every Leopard 2 is literally as good as gold for the decisive offensive,\" Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrii Melnyk told the German press on Sunday.However, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced earlier this week that Berlin cannot replace every Leopard tank destroyed on the Ukrainian battlefield. He asserted to Kiev that Germany will continue to supply repaired Leopard 1 A5 tanks starting from July. \"And by the end of the year there will be more than a hundred of them [in Ukraine's service],\" the minister said. However, according to international military observers it would be too little, too late.The Biden administration has disbursed another $325 million to provide the Kiev regime with additional M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) to replace those lost over the past week as well as ammo for HIMARS and NASAMS. The collective West is going to maximize its support for the Ukrainian counteroffensive and provide Kiev with long-term aid, as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has promised. Still, according to Maloof, this enthusiasm will be short-lived.Who's to Blame for Counteroffensive Failure?While assessing the Ukraine army's failures, Western analysts suggested that it stems from the lack of training. In general, the Western observers tend to pin the whole blame on Ukrainian soldiers unfamiliar with the NATO equipment. It's not fair, as per Matviychuk.In fact, the Western military industrial complex has been given a black eye: Rheinmetall AG, a German automotive and arms manufacturer, has already lost 15% of the value of the shares due to the fact that the Leopards got rapidly destroyed, noted Matviychuk. This is reputational damage to the US defense contractors, too, he continued. The US armored vehicles proved quite efficient in the fight against shepherds in Afghanistan and Iraq, but in Eastern Europe they failed en masse, which indicates the low quality of equipment in the first place, per the military expert.Westerners Started ProtestingIt appears that the Western public has grown weary of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict as well as of NATO member states spending billions on weapons for Kiev at the expense of their domestic economies and social programs.Matviychuk appears to share Maloof's stance:\"In Poland, there are rallies against the presence of Ukrainians and the supply of weapons, in Bulgaria there are thousands of rallies. And Germany was generally divided along the axis of the former GDR and the former FRG. (…) Even in the United States, some congressmen say that it is necessary to urgently stop the supply of weapons [to Kiev]. I think that as the conflict develops and aggravates, the majority of socially prominent citizens will advocate for an end to the war, as they are aware of the detriment, first of all, for their countries.\""

However, the sabotage has posed risks upstream, too, given that water from the Kakhovka reservoir is used to cool the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant's (NPP) six reactors and spent fuel storage. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi has recently warned that the dam's water levels are reportedly continuing to fall in the reservoir, causing a possible difference of about two meters. Per Grossi, the height of the water is crucial for the continued operability of the water pumps used for the NPP cooling.However, it is not the only risk related to the region's nuclear facilities, according to Busby. He noted that the partial damage to the Kakhovka dam causes flooding downstream and exposes sediment upstream. The physical chemist warned that apart from all the oils, chemicals, dead animals, sewage, and other dangerous stuff ending up on land when the floodwaters recede, there is a missing and invisible hazard: radiation.But that is not all, per Busby: the river bed of Dnepr could still potentially contain radionuclide elements from the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. These elements remain radioactive for a time period defined by the concept of \"half-life\" which is the time that it takes for half of the radioactivity to disappear as the radionuclide decays into a different element, giving off radiation in the process, the scientist explained.Busby appears to be deeply concerned about the seemingly lax attitude to the nuclear contamination issue demonstrated by both the Kiev regime and the West. In his previous interviews with Sputnik, Busby raised the alarm over London's decision to arm the Kiev regime with depleted uranium ammunition and a subsequent huge explosion in the Western Ukrainian town of Khmelnitsky in May resulting in nothing short of a radioactive cloud. Per Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev, the Ukrainian forces secretly stored the UK-provided depleted uranium ammo in the town. In May, the veteran chemical physicist lambasted the Ukrainian authorities over the continuous shelling of the Zaporozhye NPP, conducted by the Ukrainian armed forces and nationalist battalions on a regular basis since the time the NPP came under Russia's control.The Kiev regime's nuclear adventurism does not end here: the Russian Ministry of Defense has repeatedly warned about a potential Ukrainian false flag operation involving a \"dirty bomb,\" i.e. an explosive device loaded with radioactive materials. The Western mainstream press has been routinely downplaying or neglecting the issue, as well as Kiev's apparent prowess to create atomic weapons and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's remark about dropping the non-nuclear status made at the Munich Security Conference on February 19, 2022. On top of that, the Ukrainian press has openly discussed Kiev's options to create nuclear arms in five-seven years, or even in the matter of months in case the nation acquires a reactor for the production of weapons-grade plutonium.

The Kiev regime attacked and damaged the dam of  the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant the destruction of its upper part and the uncontrollable release of a huge amount of water down the Dnepr River. However, the sabotage has posed risks upstream, too, given that water from the Kakhovka reservoir is used to cool the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant's (NPP) six reactors and spent fuel storage. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi has recently warned that the dam's water levels are reportedly continuing to fall in the reservoir, causing a possible difference of about two meters. Per Grossi, the height of the water is crucial for the continued operability of the water pumps used for the NPP cooling. \"I warned in an earlier article about the dangers of loss of cooling water if the dam on the lake was destroyed to the extent of draining the lake,\" Dr. Christopher Busby told Sputnik. \"The dam has now been destroyed. The question now is how far will the water level fall, and where is the cooling intake pipe relative to the depth of water? It may be that the pipe can be built up and extended to where the water ends up. It may be (and let us pray) that some other technical sticky tape solution can be devised. But the situation is a very serious one.\" Analysis Preplanned Kakhovka Dam Destruction is Kiev's Crime Against Humanity and Nature 7 June, 19:02 GMT However, it is not the only risk related to the region's nuclear facilities, according to Busby. He noted that the partial damage to the Kakhovka dam causes flooding downstream and exposes sediment upstream. The physical chemist warned that apart from all the oils, chemicals, dead animals, sewage, and other dangerous stuff ending up on land when the floodwaters recede, there is a missing and invisible hazard: radiation. \"Nuclear power makes large quantities of radioactive substances which are produced when the Uranium atoms are split to provide the energy. The Zaporozhye nuclear power station, which is cooled from the lake, also discharges radioactivity routinely and this stuff ends up in the lake where it is mostly trapped in the sediment at the bottom of the lake. When the dam bursts, this material, or some of it, will end up in the floodwater to be left behind on the shores and in the houses as the water recedes. It is invisible and can only be detected with a Geiger counter, or some other sophisticated device.\" World ZNPP Still Able to Pump Water From Kakhovka Reservoir 12 June, 09:57 GMT But that is not all, per Busby: the river bed of Dnepr could still potentially contain radionuclide elements from the  Chernobyl disaster of 1986 . These elements remain radioactive for a time period defined by the concept of \"half-life\" which is the time that it takes for half of the radioactivity to disappear as the radionuclide decays into a different element, giving off radiation in the process, the scientist explained. \"Strontium 90 and Cesium 137 have half-lives of about 30 years,\" Busby said. \"Since the Chernobyl disaster was in 1986, almost half of the releases into the water table draining to the Dnepr is still there. For the Plutonium and Uranium particles, the half-lives are so great that it can be assumed they are all there. When the floods recede, there will be this Chernobyl radioactivity exposed as sediment dust in houses and on the ground. Upstream the sediment is exposed also. This is a radiation hazard. When dried out, the radioactive dust is re-suspended and is inhaled. This is just science: it has been studied and is well understood.\" Analysis Chris Busby: Europe May Face Cancer, Birth Defects Akin to Fallujah if Kiev Uses Depleted Uranium 28 March, 09:00 GMT Busby appears to be deeply concerned about the seemingly lax attitude to the nuclear contamination issue demonstrated by both the Kiev regime and the West.

Per Busby, those who are flirting with the idea of non-peaceful use of nuclear energy in Ukraine are playing with fire. \"Those people who are driving this process towards an eventual nuclear exchange have no idea what it will be like. I have studied the effects of radiation on life, not just human life, but all life. The calculations made by those who war-game nuclear exchanges are based on false and obsolete science. The reality is very like Mad Max. In this case Hollywood got it right,\" Busby concluded."

Below is his answer in full.Recently, several web media outlets provided videos of an enormous explosion in the town of Khmelnitski, located to the West of Kiev, and about 200 km from the border with Poland. There were two major explosions which produced a massive roiling swirling fireball which, like an atomic bomb, developed upwards and formed a mushroom cloud, which was black.I have represented nuclear atmospheric test veterans in the Royal Courts of Justice in London and have seen many films of nuclear explosions: this was not one. A nuclear explosion is characterised by an immediate intense white light which wipes out the camera film or detector.So, what was it? It was suggested by several commentators that an arms depot that had been hit contained the Depleted Uranium (DU) weapons sent by the UK to the Ukraine for use in the British Challenger tanks as anti-tank penetrators. That the explosion was one involving the burning of the DU in the fireball. Since I am a scientific authority on Uranium and its health effects, but have also examined its dispersion and behaviour in the environment, I will comment on what I believe happened, and why it is important. I was a member of the UK government Ministry of Defence Depleted Uranium Oversight Board(DUOB) in 2000-2005, and also the UK government Committee Examining Radiation Risk from Internal Emitters (CERRIE) 2000-2004. I am Scientific Secretary of the European Committee on Radiation Risk (ECRR) which is an independent NGO that provides advice on risk from ionising radiation.My main research interest in this area is Uranium and health, particularly the DU particles, which are so small they act as a gas and move over very large distances once they are created by the burning of DU. I found them in England in 2003 after they had come from Iraq. I found them in 2023 in England after they came from the Ukraine war. So that is the first thing: the material is able to travel very large distances.Therefore, if the Khmelnitsky explosion was a DU one, the material would move with the wind direction and should be detectable at monitor sites downwind.First, we need to say that DU has a gamma signature, it releases gamma rays. The UK and USA governments lie about this. They point to the fact that the U-238, that remains after the fissile U-235 is removed in the centrifuges (and is sent off for nuclear weapons and reactors), is a weak alpha emitter.They say that alpha radiation cannot penetrate skin and so the DU itself is harmless. That it cannot be detected by a Geiger Counter and the alpha particles don’t make it through the window. There is, of course, a health problem if the post-impact particles are inhaled and pass into the body through the lung into the lymphatic system or directly into the digestive system, but essentially DU is harmless.What you need to know is that Uranium 238, when it decays with its alpha emission, turns into Thorium-234 and Protoactinium-234m which then turns into Uranium 234. Thorium 234 is a beta and gamma emitter delivering 6% of its decay energy as a gamma ray. Thus, large clouds of DU particulate aerosol will be detectable by gamma detectors.When I visited Iraq with Al Jazeera in 2000 I went to the south and examined the corpses of the tanks that had been hit by DU in the first Gulf War. Some of the A-10 DU penetrators were still lying around. They gave off an intense gamma ray signal, and the holes in the tanks were highly gamma ray active. So much for only an alpha emitter.I am a yachtsman: examination of the UK metereological weather pressure maps tell us that at the time, and for days after the explosion, there was an anticyclone to the North of the explosion site and winds were weak but from the South East blowing North Westerly around the high-pressure area. So, the plume would move towards Poland. If the winds were about 5km/h they would reach any Poland detectors 250 km away on the 15th.After Chernobyl, the European Union set up a Europe-wide gamma radiation detector system that used to give gamma readings in real time. I went to look. But astonishingly, all the data was blocked. The web- based system, administered from Germany, (EURDEP) would not provide the detector maps that are normally available. Luckily, there were some location maps on the web and some that had been already downloaded by colleagues of mine before the system stopped working. I obtained maps from Poland. One of these I show below.You will see that a very highly significant increase in gamma radiation occurred at this detector, north west of the explosion site almost exactly when it would be expected on the basis of a distance of 250km and a mean wind speed of 5km/h. The increase, from 60nSv/h to 90nSv/h was highly statistically significant about 50%. Other detectors all across Poland showed an increase*, as the plume passed over them, the increase being weaker the further away (due to dispersion of the plume).Later, the Poles measured the increase at the Marie Curie Institute in Lublin, but their map was a more sophisticated one and needed some expert interpretation. The Polish map gave gamma increases split into two natural isotopes, Bismuth and Thallium, also total gamma and cosmic ray gamma.From the map, we are to assume (and this was the implicit message) that the gamma peak was due to Bismuth. Enter Sherlock Holmes. Bismuth 214 is a Radon daughter. The natural background radioactive gas Radon (Rn-222) is always present, since it is produced from Uranium and Radium in the ground. If there is a sudden change in atmospheric pressure, or when it rains, there is a gamma peak from Radon, which shows itself as the Bi-214 peak. So, the Poles seem to be implying that the increase in gamma radiation is normal and nothing to get scared about. Many have picked up on the Bismuth spectrum. But the way in which the Polish graphs are presented is misleading.The problem with a radon argument is first that the gamma increases go up all across Poland at a time scale that identifies a plume from Khmelnitsky and second that there was a stable anticyclone weather system and no atmospheric pressure changes that might pull radon out of the ground. I checked all that. There was only some light rain over Lublin.There is, however, an additional possibility. Very fine particles attract Radon: you get a slight increase in gamma from Radon near factory chimneys that emit fine particles.The European radiation detector system web map came back online on May 18. The map type had been changed and everything we saw in the downloads had disappeared or had been smudged out by data analysis averaging. Why? This, and the early blocking of access to the site suggest panic and cover-up.So taken all together, what we see is a massive explosion which is thought to be DU, and reports of a spike in gamma radiation near the site. Uranium oxide is black, and the black plume moves north west slowly, the weather pattern is stable and the wind blows to Poland. The Polish EU detectors all show gamma radiation increases at the expected time of arrival of the plume. The EU detector system is shut down rapidly, but not before we have obtained data from several sites. The Poles provide a detector result that identified Bismuth as the cause of the increase, but do not go so far as to formally state that it is (in case of later blowback).One final piece of evidence. We see videos on the internet of the Ukrainians clearing up the explosion site using Robot vehicles, not ordinary firemen. Why do they need Robot vehicles? The last times we saw Robot vehicles clearing up was in the ruins of Chernobyl and Fukushima.If I am right, there has been an environmental disaster, and the DU particles will travel across Poland, Germany and Hungary, and will end up in the Baltics, probably later the whole of Europe including the UK (after all, the Chernobyl Uranium particles came to the UK).They will deliver genetic damage and death like that seen in the Balkans and Iraq. Cancer, birth defects, miscarriage, infertility, lung damage, mental problems (Gulf War Syndrome) and so forth. The scientific and epidemiological evidence on this has been clear since the Gulf War. It is all there in the scientific literature—but the governments in the West and the military ignore it, deny it and cover it up. In the case of the UK coroners court finding for Stuart Dyson, the jury found that DU caused his fatal colon cancer. But when the coroner wrote to the health minister (as he had to by UK law, Rule 43) the reply was: we disagree. This stuff can be measured, but no one will measure it, or if they do, they will be attacked and their arguments dismissed.Even if I am wrong, and there is some other explanation for the gamma peaks, DU must be banned. It is a weapon of indiscriminate effect and kills civilians, the enemy and your own troops (well, Ukrainian troops). It is much worse than a war gas, like Sarin, or phosgene, mustard gas or all the other chemical agents banned by civilisation. This stuff destroys the genetic basis of life itself. And no one does anything. Those who use it base their action on obsolete science supported by dishonest epidemiology carried out by dishonest scientists and obsolete and fantastical risk models.Those who provide the weapons, the UK government in this case, are morally bankrupt. Unless it is their intention to destroy the Ukrainian people. Who knows anymore? The world has gone mad.*Poland's National Atomic Energy Agency claims there is no increase in radiation levels"

      "Text": "Ukrainian Syndrome. Anatomy of a Modern Military Confrontation  Ukrainian Syndrome. Anatomy of a Modern Military Confrontation  Listening to many Western politicians, it seems completely impossible to understand the sense and mechanisms of the conflict in modern Ukraine. Take US President Biden. He denies the direct involvement of US troops in the conflict but at the same time he mentions on every occasion the billions in weapons the US supplies to the country. 2023-01-16T14:17+0000 2023-01-16T14:17+0000 2023-01-16T16:05+0000 analysis ukraine russia us If billions are spent for military purposes in Ukraine, it means Ukrainian interests are extremely important for the US. But the US army does not want to fight there. So probably they are not so important, after all. And what about these weapon supplies worth billions of dollars? Are they donations? Is it a profitable business? Investments? Some political combination? No answers, only smoke.Or take the most recent revelations by German ex-Chancellor Merkel that the Minsk Agreements were just an attempt to give Ukraine time. Which means no one was ever going to establish peace in Ukraine. So, Russia was deceived. But what was the purpose? To protect Ukraine or to invade it themselves? Why did they need this deception if they could simply implement what was recommended by Germany? Or did Germany deliberately recommend something that could never be implemented? We could go as far as asking if political swindlers could be drawn to accountability, but it seems much more relevant today to start clearing the smoke around the current situation. That is how it has played out, anyway. But what were the root causes? And how can we get out of this situation, that is getting ever more dangerous? So let us begin our analysis by looking at the origins.What Was the Outcome of the Cold War?The beginning of a new war usually finds its origin in the end of a previous one. The Ukraine conflict was preceded by the Cold War. The answer to the question about its outcome will bring us closer to understanding of the essence of the current conflict, one which extends beyond Ukraine and affects many countries. The thing is that Western countries and the countries of the post-Soviet space, primarily Russia, have different perceptions of the outcome of this conflict.The West definitely considers itself as a winner and Russia as a defeated party. Since, in their eyes, Russia was defeated, then the territories of the former USSR and the Eastern Bloc are the legitimate prey of the US and NATO and are subject to control by the West under the motto “Woe to the Conquered!” Hence Ukraine is in the zone of influence of the US and NATO, and certainly not Russia. So, any of Russia’s claims to at least any influence on Ukrainian politics and protection of its interests in the region are “groundless” and a clear infringement on the interests of the US and NATO. “We no longer have to view the world through a prism of East-West relations. The Cold War is over” – declared Margaret Thatcher in the early 1990s. It means the position of the East, of Russia, is no longer relevant. There is one vector, one master of the universe, one winner.Russia has a completely different view of this process. In no way does it consider itself as a defeated party. The end of the Cold War was brought about by democratic reforms of political and economic life, and military confrontation was replaced by trade and integration with the West. So, if one’s former foe becomes a friend today, is it not a victory? Besides, the USSR and then the Russian Federation never had the goal of winning the Cold War but rather exiting the military confrontation between East and West that could have ended with a nuclear catastrophe. Moscow, together with Washington, found this way out, having reached the goals not so much for themselves as for the whole world.This way out by no means implied that the West would take over the East and subordinate the post-Soviet space in economic, legal and cultural respects. Quite the contrary: it implied equal cooperation and joint work to build a new political and economic reality. So, there are clearly two different attitudes to the outcome of the Cold War: the triumph of the winners, on the one part, and building a new world and a new civilization, on the other. The difference between these two attitudes would predetermine the developments that followed.New World or New Western Colonies?In 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed, but in 1992 the European Union was established – something the post-Soviet space including Russia associated big hopes with. Here, at last, there seemed to be a new world, a new supranational body, a new turn in the history of Western civilization. Russia, just like other states of the former Eastern Bloc and the USSR, saw itself in the future as an equal member of this Union. The vision of “Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok” was born.In this context, Russia welcomed not only the reunification of Germany but also the accession of its former allies and even former Soviet republics to the EU. In the 1990s, economic integration with the West was a priority for Russia; Moscow considered it as key to its success as a modern state. The Russian leadership had no particular desire to bind to itself the former Soviet republics, including Ukraine. Most of the Soviet republics had lived off subsidies from the central government, in other words, Russia. So, the leaders of these countries were given a friendly pat on the shoulder while Moscow sought to get rid of their economic burden as soon as possible.Faster than Ukraine, Russia began to integrate into the European market. Russia had vast volumes of energy resources that are in demand in Europe, while Ukraine, on the contrary, couldn’t afford to buy energy resources at European prices. Ukrainian independence could well have ended with an economic meltdown but for the South-East, where heavy fighting is going on right now. With its vast production facilities and advanced industry, the South-East helped Ukraine find its place in the international division of labor. One would not normally mention this fact, but in the 1990s it was the Russian-speaking South-East that saved the economic and hence political independence of Ukraine.Now let us turn to something different. Since the 1990s, a series of major ethnic conflicts and wars involving millions of people emerged in Europe and close to its borders. Until 1991, there had not been such a big number of ethnic clashes. All of this led to the break-up of Yugoslavia and loss by Georgia, Moldova and Syria of their territorial integrity. This does not make any sense if we look at it from the perspective of European integration. The goal of this union was not the fragmentation of Europe into a multitude of small states, but quite the contrary: the creation of a huge supranational union of nations, and these nations would not have to exterminate each other, nor to multiply the borders, but rather build a new world together. So, what was wrong here?It only seems wrong if one relies on the concept that Russia used to stick to. And if one proceeds from the concept of the victory of the West in the Cold War, then ethnic conflicts acquire a completely different meaning. The latter was articulated on numerous occasions, e.g., at the meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on October 24, 1995, when US President Bill Clinton said: “Using the blunders of Soviet diplomacy, the extreme arrogance of Gorbachev and his entourage, including those who openly took a pro-American position, we achieved what President Truman was going to do with the Soviet Union through the atomic bomb.”It suggests that far from all Western politicians wanted to build a new and just world. Their goal was to defeat the adversary – the USSR, Yugoslavia and other states. In this sense, the escalation of interethnic conflicts seems only logical, as they weaken the adversary and in the case of a victory, they help to dismember the country to make it easier for the winner to take over.Under these circumstances, the real state of affairs does not play any role. The situation is being deliberately escalated. On the one hand, representatives of the titular nation are being declared as organizers of the genocide, annihilating the foreign language and culture and performing ethnic cleansing. On the other hand, representatives of the national minority living in communities in certain parts of the country are being declared separatists and a threat to the state. This tactic dates back to ancient times and was used by the Roman Empire. But the building of a new slaveholding empire is not something we are witnessing these days, is it? Or probably Washington, for example, does consider the post-Soviet space as some provinces of a greater empire that already have their metropole and should be protected from Barbarians who do not want to be under the control of this empire?So, there are two political strategies: the economic and political integration of the countries with mutual benefit at the cornerstone, and the take-over of some countries by the others, with zero respect for the interests of the states that are being taken over. Such countries can be dismembered, declared rogue states or conquered.Let us elaborate on this in more detail. Russia has taken Western democracy as a model, carried out reforms and begun to integrate into the Western world. From the point of view of building a common European house, this should be welcomed and encouraged. Europe gets a peaceful and economically reliable partner along with its markets and resources, which certainly makes it even stronger. But if one is guided by colonial thinking, one would not tolerate the economic growth and independence of a distant colony. Provinces should not overtake the metropole, neither financially, nor politically, nor culturally.There is the EU that was engaged in building a new economic reality. And there is the NATO established in 1949 that confronted the East, primarily the USSR and later Russia. Remember the words by the first Secretary-General of the NATO Hastings Ismay: the bloc was intended “to keep the Americans in, the Russians out and the Germans down.” Thus, the NATO ideology implies that the US is in Europe, and in a dominating position, and Russia is not.But how should Russia take it? It ended the Cold War in good faith, while it seems that the US and the NATO have not. Which means that unification with the West intended for Russia will not happen on equal terms, but rather take the form of an economic and political take-over. Hence Moscow’s requirement to stop the enlargement towards Russia’s borders and revise the attitudes and the agreements. What we see now is that the NATO concept has not only derailed Russia’s integration into Europe but closed the door to Europe’s expansion and development. Of the two concepts mentioned in this article, one has clearly defeated the other.Russia and Ukraine – the Tragedy of RelationshipsLet us move on from the general picture directly to relations between Russia and Ukraine. Let us start from the fact that the relations between these countries have their own specific history. These relationships are closer than the collaboration between England and Scotland, or the Northern and Southern States of the US. Ukraine was part of Russia for more than three hundred years, which influenced its culture, ethnic composition and mentality. Ukraine’s independence in 1991 was gained through an agreement with Moscow, not as a result of a national struggle for liberation. The new economic and political reality prompted the Russian elite not only to grant independence to Ukraine, but also to push for it. At that time, no one could have imagined an armed clash between the two new states, even in a nightmare. The Ukrainians saw Russia as a friendly state, and the Russians as a fraternal nation, and these sentiments were shared by Russians.In Russia, for a long time, the concept of “Another Russia” prevailed with respect to Ukraine, which supposes much closer relations than, for example, those between Britain and Canada. There was a popular saying in everyday life: \"We have one people, but different states.\" Ukrainians and Russians were very interested in the political life of their respective neighbors. A suitable example is the current President of Ukraine Zelensky, who made a living from political satire, usually based on the politics of both states.However, the example of Ukraine clearly demonstrates how the concept of creating a common political and economic space was defeated by the concept of squeezing Russia out of Europe. In the wake of the first ‘Maidan’ color revolution in 2005, Ukraine started building anti-Russian policy at the level of state ideology. In this, one can see clearly that this policy follows the templates of the Cold War. That is, psychologically, the Ukrainians were turned against the Russians through the support of certain politicians, changes in the educational system, in culture and in national media broadcasting. All of this came under the guise of democratic reforms and positive changes supported by all sorts of Western and international organizations.Within Ukraine itself, two countries had existed since 1991: Anti-Russia, and Ukraine as another Russia. While one does not think itself without Russia, the other does not think of itself with Russia. However, this division is quite artificial. Ukraine has spent most of its history with Russia, and it is tied to it culturally and mentally.Ukraine’s integration with Russia is definitely dictated by the economy. After all, if there is such a huge market and resources nearby, only a very shallow power could not use it, or go so far as to block it. Anti-Russian sentiments have brought Ukraine nothing but grief and poverty. Therefore, all pro-Western nationalist movements consciously or unconsciously preach poverty and destitution to the Ukrainian people.We have already mentioned that it was the South-East with its production potential that helped the country find its footing in the international division of labor. It turned out that most of the money was earned by the East, a large Russian-speaking region. Naturally, this could not but effect its political representation in the Ukrainian government. The South-East had more human resources and financial tools, which did not fit into the pro-Western picture of Ukraine. The people who lived there were too proud, too free, and too rich.Both the first and second Maidans were directed against Viktor Yanukovych, the former governor of Donetsk, the leader of Donbass and non-nationalist centrist political forces. Electoral support for such forces was very significant, and Ukraine did not want to be ‘Anti-Russia’ for a very long time. President Yushchenko, who arrived with the first Maidan, very quickly lost the confidence of the people, for the most part because of his anti-Russian policies.Then an interesting trend emerged in Ukrainian politics. The elections after the second Maidan are won by President Poroshenko, who promised peace with Russia in one week. So, he was elected as a peacemaker president. Nevertheless, he became the president of the war, failed to implement the Minsk Agreements, and miserably lost the following election. He was replaced by Vladimir Zelensky, who also promised peace, but became the personification of war. So, the Ukrainian people are promised peace and then they are deceived. Having gained power under the rhetoric of peacemaking, he becomes the second Ukrainian leader to have taken an extremely radical position. If he had such a position at the beginning of the election campaign, no one would have elected him.And now let us return to the general concept of this article. If one says that one is going to build a new world with the neighbors but simply pushes one’s own interests, regardless of anything, even war, even the threat of nuclear conflict, then obviously one is not going to build anything. This is what the ex-president of Ukraine Poroshenko did and this is what the current president Zelensky is doing, but not only them. This is what the NATO leadership and many American and European politicians are doing.Before the armed conflict, Zelensky simply crushed any opposition, pushing through the interests of his party; he did not build any peace. In Ukraine, politicians, journalists, and public activists who spoke about peace and good-neighborly relations with Russia were repressed before the military clash, their media were closed without any legal grounds, and their property was plundered. When the Ukrainian authorities were reproached for violating the rule of law and freedom of speech, the answer was that the peace party was \"a bunch of traitors and propagandists.\" And the democratic West was satisfied with this answer.In reality, the situation was not so simple and straightforward. \"Traitors and propagandists\" represented, including in the parliament, not just the lion's share of the electorate, but also the basis of the country's economic potential. So, the blow fell not only on democracy, but also on the well-being of the citizens. Zelensky's policy has led to a situation where people began to leave Ukraine en masse due to adverse economic and social conditions, repression, and political persecution. Among them were a lot of Ukrainian politicians, journalists, businessmen, and cultural and religious figures who had done a lot for this country. These people have been excluded from politics and public life by the Ukrainian authorities, although they have the right to have their own position, no less than Zelensky and his team.The business of the South-East of the country is largely tied to Russia and its interests; that is why the conflict has ceased to be an exclusively internal matter. Russia was faced with the need to protect not only its economic interests, but also international honor and dignity, which, as was shown above, had been systematically denied. There was no one to rectify the situation. The Ukrainian peace party was declared to be treacherous and power was seized by the war party. The conflict dragged on, and took on an international dimension.It would seem that politics still mean something in Europe, but the politicians massively support Zelensky, dragging Europe into the war and towards the bloc’s economic downfall. It is no longer Europe that teaches Ukraine politics, but Ukraine that teaches Europe how to achieve economic decline and poverty with the help of a policy of hatred and intransigence. If Europe continues to support this policy, it will be dragged into a war, possibly into a nuclear one.And now let us get back to where we started. The Cold War ended with a political decision to build a new world with no wars. It is clear that such a world has never been built, that current global politics has returned to where it started: with detente. Now there are only two ways out: to slide into a world war and a nuclear confrontation, or to restart the process of detente, for which it is necessary to take into account the interests of all parties. But for this to happen, it is necessary first to acknowledge that Russia has its own interests and that they must be taken into account in the creation of a new detente. And, most importantly, to play honestly, not to deceive anyone, not to blow smoke, and not to make money on someone else's blood. But if the global political system is not capable of elementary decency; if it is blinded by pride and its own mercantile interests, then even harder times await us.The Ukraine conflict will either grow further, spilling over to Europe and other countries, or it will be localized and resolved. But how can it be resolved if the party of war reigns supreme in Ukraine, escalating military hysteria that has already gone beyond the borders of the country, and the West for some reason stubbornly calls it democracy? This party of war has declared an infinite number of times that it does not need any peace: what it needs is more weapons and money for the war. These people have built their politics and business on the war, they have rapidly upgraded their international ratings. In Europe and in the US they are greeted with applause, they should not be asked uncomfortable questions, there should be no doubt in their sincerity and truthfulness. The Ukrainian party of war keeps delivering triumph after triumph, while no military breakthrough is observed.But the Ukrainian party of peace is favored neither in Europe nor in the US. This eloquently suggests that most US and European politicians do not want any peace for Ukraine. But this does not mean at all that the Ukrainians do not want peace, or that Zelensky's military triumph is more important to them than their lives and destroyed homes. It is just that those who stood for peace were slandered, intimidated and repressed following the incitement of the West. The Ukrainian party of peace simply did not fit into Western democracy.And here the question arises: if the party of peace and civil dialogue does not fit into some kind of democracy, then is it a democracy? Perhaps, in order to save their country, the Ukrainians have to now start building their own democracy and open their civil dialogue without Western curators, the result of their governance of which is harmful and destructive. If the West does not want to listen to the point of view of the Other Ukraine, then this is its own business, but for Ukraine such a point of view is important and necessary, otherwise this nightmare will never end. This means that it is necessary to create a political movement composed of those who have not given up, who have not renounced their beliefs on pain of death and imprisonment, who do not want their country to become a place of geopolitical showdowns. The Ukrainian situation is catastrophically complex and dangerous, but it has nothing to do with what Zelensky says every day."

Judge Steenhuis also said that The Hague District Court ruled that the crash of the MH17 plane was connected to a non-international armed conflict in eastern Ukraine.The court went on to claim that the Buk missile was delivered from Russia to Ukraine and then taken back to Russia, however, it's unclear as to who gave the command to launch the missile. Judge Steenhuis then said that the four defendants, Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov and Leonid Kharchenko were not a single group, but were \"connected\" to the use of the Buk system.Complex CaseThe tragedy of Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 Flight MH17 occurred on July 17, 2014, as the plane was flying over Ukraine en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. At the time, Ukraine was embroiled in a major crisis due to a violent February coup d’état in Kiev. The Donbass region refused to submit to the Kiev radicals and proclaimed their independence, becoming the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics.The plane route over Donbass was approved by Ukrainian authorities despite the fact that Kiev's forces were engaged in military clashes with local militia there.The aircraft was downed outside a village in the eastern part of the Donetsk People's Republic. All 298 people aboard died, among them 196 Dutch and 43 Malaysian (including the 15-member flight crew) nationals.Kiev immediately blamed the DPR and Moscow for the crash, claiming that Russia provided the DPR militia with the missile system linked to the tragedy. At the same time, western countries rushed to place sanctions on Russia without probing the incident.A Dutch-led Joint Investigative Team (JIT) formed in August 2014 to investigate the crash accused Moscow of involvement in the downing. Russia was not allowed to take part in the criminal probe, and any evidence provided by the country was ignored by the JIT.In June 2015, with the JIT probe still underway, the Dutch government began preparations to create an international tribunal to prosecute those responsible. Amsterdam took its case to the UN, where Russia slapped it down as an attempt \"to organize a grandiose political show, which only damages efforts to find the guilty parties.\"In September 2016, JIT investigators claimed that a Russian-made Buk 9M83 surface-to-air missile was used to shoot down the airliner, alleging that the missile system was actually brought to Donetsk from a Russian military base on the same day the aircraft was destroyed.The accusations prompted the Russian military and Buk missile system maker Almaz-Antey to carry out their own comprehensive probes, with the Russian weapons manufacturer examining forensic evidence, declassifying top secret information about its military hardware, and carrying out a complex recreation of the events leading to the plane’s destruction involving ballistics, flight trajectory and other pertinent information. In September 2016, Almaz-Antey released its findings, concluding that the Buk missile used to destroy the Malaysian airliner was an older variant built in the 1980s, and which had been phased out of Russia’s arsenals in a modernization campaign - while the same variant was pretty much widespread in the Ukrainian military.Moscow attempted to provide these findings to the JIT, which ignored them and continued to rely on its own \"extensive comparative research,\" including the \"expert opinion\" of Bellingcat, a western intelligence front posing as an \"open source intelligence research\" service.In 2017, Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders announced that the JIT would prosecute anyone found guilty for MH17 under Dutch law. In June 2019, three Russian nationals and one Ukrainian were charged, and international arrest warrants were issued against them. Their trial began in March 2020, with all of the accused tried in absentia. Prosecutors sought life sentences.In July 2020, Amsterdam announced its intention to take Russia to the European Court of Human Rights for its “role” in the shoot down, with Moscow countering by filing its own case with the court accusing Ukraine of the crime in July 2021. Ukraine had likewise filed a case with the court in February 2021.ECtHR proceedings were made immaterial in 2022, with Russian lawmakers moving to quit the court in June, citing western politicians’ efforts to turn the body into a kangaroo court against Russia. Moscow ceased being a party to the European Convention on Human Rights in September, six months after its expulsion from the Council of Europe."

However, with the missile hitting Poland yesterday, first the Polish president and then Joe Biden said within hours that while a proper investigation was needed, the available intelligence on the trajectory of the missile excluded its being fired from Russia. Why this very different development of the case? Because there is a proxy war going on now and USA/NATO did not want an escalation to nuclear war through pushing a false flag story,” the observer suggested.Political commentator and author Joe Quinn echoed Doctorow’s characterization of the verdict as a “foregone conclusion,” suggesting the Hague “was always going to find Russia guilty,” because that was “the premise of the investigation from the outset.”The commentator suggested that “any sober analysis” of the JIT's findings would show that the investigation was slanted against these ‘Russian-backed separatists’ “and by extension [against] Russia,” to prove them guilty.“To reach this conclusion they were required to avoid giving any serious credence to evidence presented by the Russian government. The JIT's final conclusions were primarily based on unnamed 'eyewitnesses' and 'insiders'. The credibility of the statements of these people has not been subject to impartial scrutiny,” Quinn said.Asked why the US never bothered to release satellite data related to the MH17 crash which could prove Russia's innocence, the commentator emphasized that the US government “has a vested interest in withholding any and all information that would disprove” the ‘Russia did it’ thesis. “The same applies to the authorities in Kiev and Holland.”Quinn is convinced that there was “zero possibility” for the verdict to be anything other than it was, since the destruction of MH17 was a “political event” – one “that occurred in the context of the ongoing geopolitical rivalry between Russia and the US, and more broadly 'East vs West'.”Tiberio Graziani, chairman of Vision &#38;amp; Global Trends, a Rome-based geopolitical affairs think tank, expressed similar sentiments, saying that “given the current circumstances related to the crisis between the West and the Russian Federation,” Thursday’s verdict could not have been nonpolitical. “Russia was not allowed to participate in the trial in which it was directly accused, precisely because it was considered - a priori – guilty from the outset. We recall that the tragic event was used right from the start in the context of the long hybrid war that the West has waged since at least the early years of this century. Furthermore, in [this] specific case, the question of the insurance companies that will have to pay the damages must also be taken into account,” Graziani said.‘Farce Masquerading as a Trial’Christopher C. Black, an international criminal and human rights lawyer with over 20 years of experience covering war crimes and international relations under his belt, provided Sputnik with an in-depth account of the question marks surrounding the MH17 saga and, like his counterparts above, characterized Thursday’s verdict as the “conclusion of a farce masquerading as a trial.”Black pointed out that from the outset, Washington and its allies blamed the Donbass republics for shooting down the passenger airliner, despite no evidence that the militias even had access to the sophisticated Buk anti-aircraft missiles allegedly used in the crime (but which Kiev did have).“Also ignored was the eyewitness evidence of civilians on the ground who observed at least one Kiev Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jet ascend and approach the civilian airliner and that, immediately afterwards, the plane crashed. There were reports as well that a Spanish air traffic controller in Kiev, known as Carlos, sent out messages on Twitter contemporaneous with the shoot down, using the Twitter address @Spainbuca, that he observed this on his radar and overheard the pilot’s conversations with Kiev air traffic control confirming that the Ukraine jet shot down the plane. There are later reports that a Ukrainian pilot admitted he flew the plane that shot it down. Both these men have since disappeared from view. Remarkably, the investigating body has never followed up these important facts,” Black emphasized.The observer noted that the Hague has refused to follow up on any information related to the incident provided by the Russian government, and pointed out that since the plane was downed in Donbass territory, under international law, it should have been the Donetsk People’s Republic which led the investigation into the plane’s destruction, recognition or no recognition.“But the Donetsk Republic was denied that role by the Kiev regime which claimed it took place in Ukraine territory and so assumed the role of investigator and then, under NATO, and especially American pressure, delegated the investigation to NATO, in the guise of the Dutch Safety Board, on the justification that the majority of the passengers were Dutch,” Black said.Black stressed that the Dutch Safety Board’s 2015 report on the incident simply ignored any evidence pointing to Kiev’s responsibility for the plane’s destruction, such as the holes found in the airliner’s fuselage which “match the 30mm cannon shells used by the Kiev Sukhoi Su-25…seen approaching the plane.”Black also pointed to the mysterious January 2017 detention by Dutch police of a pair of journalists and the seizure of their equipment, cameras, phones, notes and interview materials on MH17, characterizing that incident as a \"blatant attempt by the Dutch government to suppress the evidence these journalists gathered.\"\"It is only reasonable to conclude that the NATO authorities are worried in case these journalists found evidence confirming NATO culpability for the incident. After all, [they] had written an article about it and announced that they were willing to share the information with the Dutch government. But apparently there is a fear in NATO that they might share too much with too many and so pounced on them and robbed them and us of the information they had before they could. The Dutch government has yet to offer a legal justification for this seizure,” the observer said.The Hague District Court found Russian nationals Igor Girkin (aka Igor Streklov) and Sergei Dubinsky and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko guilty in the downing of MH17, sentencing them in absentia to life in jail. The men were also ordered to pay over 16 million euros in compensation to the families of the 298 victims of the plane crash. Moscow blasted the \"politicized\" decision.Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 Flight MH17 went down in the eastern Donetsk People's Republic on July 17, 2014 while on route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. The plane's route over the Donbass was approved by Ukrainian authorities despite the fact that Kiev forces and local militias were engaged in fierce clashes in the area. All 298 people aboard the aircraft were killed."

Глава запорожского общественного движения \"Мы вместе с Россией\" Владимир Рогов заявил, что, по имеющейся у него информации, подготовку сценария провокации киевского режима на Запорожской АЭС курируют британские спецслужбы. \"По крайней мере, именно они курируют данную провокацию по линии главного управления разведки Минобороны Зеленского и СБУ\", - сказал РИА Новости Рогов. По его словам, киевские власти могут решиться как на удар по сухому хранилищу отработанного ядерного топлива (СХОЯТ), так и по самой атомной станции. По его мнению, заставить киевские власти отказаться от провокации в отношении Запорожской АЭС сможет только понимание, что все причастные к ядерному терроризму будут отвечать за это головой - вплоть до ликвидации. \"Только страх личной ответственности перед неминуемым наказанием может заставить их отказаться от данного преступления\", - подчеркнул Рогов. Запорожская АЭС расположена на левом берегу Днепра рядом с городом Энергодар. Это самая крупная по числу блоков и установленной мощности АЭС в Европе – на станции насчитывается шесть энергоблоков мощностью по 1 гигаватту. В октябре 2022 года атомная станция перешла в собственность РФ. Украинские военные продолжают регулярно обстреливать Энергодар и прилегающую к городу территорию Запорожской АЭС. Министр обороны РФ Сергей Шойгу говорил, что киевский режим стремится создать видимость угрозы ядерной катастрофы, продолжая целенаправленно обстреливать ЗАЭС. Международное агентство по атомной энергии неоднократно заявляло о необходимости создания зоны безопасности вокруг ЗАЭС."

Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters during the 2023 St. Petersburg International Economic Forum that Kiev had failed to reach any strategic objectives since the beginning of its counteroffensive, losing 186 tanks and 418 armored vehicles. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said recently that “16 days of intense hostilities” had prompted Ukrainian forces to markedly wind down their activity, not least because they had “suffered significant losses” both in men and materiel during the counteroffensive. But for all its losses, the regime in Kiev is firmly on its donors' hook, as the Western alliance has been pumping weapons to support the US-led proxy war against Russia in Ukraine. The billions of dollars' worth of military equipment, which Moscow has repeatedly warned is a legitimate target that only prolongs the conflict, is being meticulously obliterated by the Russian Armed Forces. Ukraine, meanwhile, has wedged itself between a rock and a hard place, as it is no longer in a position to make independent decisions, and jumps to the bidding of its handlers.In the West, amid a growing weariness of the Ukraine conflict and anti-Russia sanctions that have backfired on both US and European economies, all eyes are on Kiev to display some degree of success if it doesn't want the stream of assistance to run dry.Meanwhile, as the Ukrainian offensive \"treads water,\" so to say, EU capitals have been prompted to rethink the level of support they believe Kiev needs. The EU leaders’ summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday is gearing up to offer “future security commitments” to Ukraine, to be laid out in draft conclusions, according to reports. At the meeting, taking place less than two weeks before the NATO alliance summit in Vilnius next month, France and Germany are cited as falling in line with US- and UK-driven calls to provide Ukraine with bilateral security arrangements, coupled with long-term financing, military assistance, training, and intelligence assistance. A proposed EU declaration, the text of which was ostensibly conceived by France, would send “a very clear political signal” of enduring support for Ukraine, an insider was cited as saying. Earlier, French media reported, citing sources, that the Macron government was weighing the option of Ukraine joining NATO as an independent security guarantee.France's plans to support Ukraine's accession to NATO prove that Paris continues to slide towards the bloc's radical minority that sees itself as a party to the conflict in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted, adding that such actions may result in tragic consequences for European and global security."

Yuriy Malashko, governor of Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region, said a guided aviation bomb was used in Sunday’s attack on a school building being used to distribute humanitarian aid in the small town of Orikhiv. Malashko called  the attack a “war crime”. “They hit a humanitarian aid delivery spot in a residential area,” Malashko said on social media. “Four people died on the spot: women aged 43, 45 and 47 and a 47-year-old man.” The death toll has since increased, officials said. “Rescuers removed the bodies of three people with no signs of life from under the rubble. The number of dead has risen to seven,” Ukraine’s emergency services wrote on Telegram later on Monday. Rescue and recovery operations were now complete.

Ukraine’s general prosecutor’s office said the incident was being investigated as a war crime. The prosecutor’s office also said that two people had been killed and three wounded on Monday in Russian shelling of the village of Hostre and the city of Avdiivka in the Donetsk region. Orikhiv, with a pre-war population of around 14,000 people, is in the front line southeastern region of Zaporizhia where Ukrainian soldiers last month were  pushing to recapture heavily fortified positions from Russian forces."

CNN first reported last week that US President Joe Biden’s administration was strongly considering approving the transfer of the controversial weapons to Ukraine, whose forces have been struggling to make major gains in a weeks-long counteroffensive. Here’s what you need to know about the weapons – and why they are controversial. What is a cluster munition? Cluster munitions, also called cluster bombs, are canisters that carry tens to hundreds of smaller bomblets, also known as submunitions. The canisters can be dropped from aircraft, launched from missiles or fired from artillery, naval guns or rocket launchers. The canisters break open at a prescribed height, depending upon the area of the intended target, and the bomblets inside spread out over that area. They are fused by a timer to explode closer to or on the ground, spreading shrapnel that is designed to kill troops or take out armored vehicles such as tanks. A cluster bomb capsule at the frontline city of Avdiivka, Ukraine on March 23, 2023.  Andre Luis Alves/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images What type of cluster bomb is the US said to be giving to Ukraine? The US has a stockpile of cluster munitions known as DPICMs, or dual-purpose improved conventional munitions, that it no longer uses after phasing them out in 2016.  According to an article on the US Army’s eArmor website, the DPICMs Washington will give to Kyiv are fired from 155mm howitzers, with each canister carrying 88 bomblets. Each bomblet has a lethal range of about 10 square meters, so a single canister can cover an area up to 30,000 square meters (about 7.5 acres), depending upon the height it releases the bomblets. The bomblets in a DPICM have shaped charges that, when striking a tank or armored vehicle, “create a metallic jet that perforates metallic armor,” the article says, adding that it can take 10 or more bomblets to destroy an armored vehicle, but it may take only one to disable the armored vehicle’s weapons or render it immobile. What are cluster munitions? Cluster munitions contain multiple explosives that are released over an area up to the size of several football fields. They can be dropped from a plane or launched from the ground or sea. The submunitions are released in flight and fall to the ground. They can range from the tens to many hundreds They are designed to explode on impact but as many as a third don’t, and remain a deadly risk to civilians for years to come 94% of recorded cluster bomb casualties are civilians, of which almost 40% are children Note: Cluster munitions can vary widely in design and scale, this graphic only aims to explain their general function. Source: Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining, Cluster Munition Coalition Graphic: Connie Chen and Henrik Pettersson, CNN Have cluster bombs been used in the war in Ukraine before? Yes, both the Ukrainians and the Russians have used cluster bombs since Moscow’s forces invaded in February 2022. More recently, Ukrainian forces have begun using Turkish-provided cluster munitions on the battlefield. But Ukrainian officials have been pushing the US to provide its cluster munitions since last year, arguing that they would provide more ammunition for Western-provided artillery and rocket systems, and help narrow Russia’s numerical superiority in artillery. Why are cluster munitions more controversial than other bombs? As the bomblets fall over a wide area, they can endanger non-combatants.  In addition, somewhere between 10% to 40% of the munitions fail, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The unexploded munitions can then be detonated by civilian activity years or even decades later. The Cluster Munition Coalition, an activist group trying to get the weapons banned everywhere, says potentially deadly cluster submunitions still lie dormant in Laos and Vietnam 50 years after their use. A US defense official told CNN the munitions Washington would be sending to Ukraine have a “dud rate” of 2.35% or lower, based on live-fire testing done as recently as 2020. However, critics have raised questions about the military’s testing process, including whether it was done in ideal conditions, or tested under different weather and terrain conditions that might affect how the munition reacts. The defense official did not address whether the munitions were tested under those different conditions.  Announcement exposes divisions The White House is defending its transfer of the weapons, despite the concerns on the possible effects on civilians. “While Russia is using them in Ukraine in an aggressive war on another country and indiscriminately killing civilians, the Ukrainians will be using these cluster munitions – obviously, which have a very low dud rate, but they’ll be using to defend their own territory hitting Russian positions,” National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby told ABC on Sunday. “We can all agree that more civilians have been and will continue to be killed by Russian forces with whether it’s cluster munitions drones, missile attacks, or just frontal assaults, then will likely be hurt by the use of these cluster munitions fired at Russian positions inside Ukrainian territory,” Kirby added. Reacting to Kirby’s comments, the Russian Embassy in Washington condemned the decision likening it to “war crimes.” In a statement Friday, Human Rights Watch said both Ukraine and Russia had killed civilians with their use of cluster munitions in the war so far. “Cluster munitions remain one of the world’s most treacherous weapons. They kill and maim indiscriminately and cause widespread human suffering,” Gilles Carbonnier, vice president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said at a conference on the munition in Switzerland last year. “Any use of cluster munitions, anywhere, by anyone, must be condemned,” Carbonnier said. Much of the world has banned the use of these weapons through the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), which also prohibits the stockpiling, production and transfer of them.  Though 123 nations have joined that convention, the United States, Ukraine, Russia and 71 other countries have not. Using the munitions to attack enemy troops or vehicles is not illegal under international law, but striking civilians with the weapons could amount to a war crime, according to Human Rights Watch. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Saturday his country, a key NATO ally, is a signatory to the treaty banning cluster munitions, and “discourages” their use. Another NATO ally, Spain, put forth even stronger opposition to the transfer. “While respecting the decisions of the sovereign country of the United States, Spain does not share their (judgment) in sending cluster bombs, we are against sending cluster bombs,” Spanish Defense Minister Magarita Robles said. Where have cluster bombs been used before? Cluster weapons have been used as far back as World War II and in more than three dozen conflicts since, according to the Cluster Munition Coalition. The US last used the weapons in Iraq from 2003 to 2006, the coalition says. US forces began phasing them out in 2016 because of the danger they pose to civilians, according to a 2017 statement from US Central Command."

      "Text": "What are cluster bombs and why is US sending them to Ukraine? Published 19 hours ago Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image source,  Joel Gunter/BBC Image caption,  Distinctive marks from a cluster munition in the roof of a car next to a playground in Kharkiv By Frank Gardner BBC security correspondent The US has announced it is complying with a Ukrainian request to supply it with controversial cluster munitions.  The move has been criticised by human rights groups as the weapon is banned by more than 100 countries. What are cluster munitions? Cluster munitions are a method of dispersing large numbers of tiny bomblets from a rocket, missile or artillery shell that scatters them in mid-flight over a wide area.  They are intended to explode on impact but a significant proportion are &quot;duds&quot;, meaning they don&#x27;t explode initially - this happens especially if they land on wet or soft ground.  They can then explode at a later date on being picked up or trodden on, killing or maiming the victim.  From a military perspective, they can be horribly effective when used against dug-in ground troops in trenches and fortified positions, rendering large areas too dangerous to move around in until carefully cleared. Why are they banned? More than 100 countries, including the UK, France and Germany, have signed an international treaty - the Convention on Cluster Munitions - that outlaws the use or stockpiling of these weapons due to their indiscriminate effect on civilian populations.  Children are particularly prone to injury as the bomblets can resemble a small toy left in a residential or farmland area and are often picked up out of curiosity.  Human rights groups have described cluster munitions as &quot;abhorrent&quot; and even a war crime. Who still uses them? Both Russia and Ukraine have been using cluster munitions since the start of Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion in February 2022.  Neither have signed the treaty banning them. Nor has the US, but it has previously criticised Russia&#x27;s extensive use of the weapon.  Russian cluster munitions reportedly have a &quot;dud rate&quot; of 40%, meaning large numbers remain a hazard on the ground, whereas the average dud rate is believed to be close to 20%.  The Pentagon estimates its own cluster bomblets have a dud rate of less than 3%. Why is Ukraine asking for them? Ukraine&#x27;s forces are running desperately low on artillery shells, largely because, like the Russians, they use them up at an extraordinarily high rate and Ukraine&#x27;s Western allies cannot replace them at the speed they are needed.  In the largely static, grinding battlefronts of southern and eastern Ukraine, artillery has become a key weapon.  The Ukrainians now face a daunting task in trying to dislodge the invading Russians from their well dug-in defensive positions stretched along a 1,000km (621-mile) battlefront.  In the absence of enough artillery shells, Ukraine has asked the US to re-stock its supplies of cluster munitions to target the Russian infantry manning all those defensive trenches.  Some experts say that by using cluster bombs to suppress enemy fire from the trenches, Ukrainian forces could gain precious time to help them clear their way through Russian minefields. But others say there is no need for them, arguing that different types of conventional weapons could do the job just as well. This has not been an easy decision for Washington, and is deeply unpopular with many Democrats and human rights advocates. The debate has been going on for at least six months. What effect will this US decision have? The immediate effect will be to knock away much of the moral ground Washington sits on in this war.  Russia&#x27;s numerous alleged war crimes are well-documented but this move is likely to draw accusations of US hypocrisy.  Cluster munitions are a hideous, indiscriminate weapon that is banned in much of the world for good reason.  This US move will inevitably place it somewhat at odds with its Western allies and any perceived split in that alliance is exactly what Russian President Vladimir Putin wants and needs."

By  Olena Harmash July 7, 2023 3:54 PM UTC Updatedago Summary Companies After millions of Ukrainians fled, workforce badly depleted Most refugees women with higher education, some won&#x27;t return Ukraine&#x27;s population could shrink by a third over 30 years Officials and business leaders fret over impact to economy KYIV, July 7 (Reuters) - With war dragging on, some of Ukraine&#x27;s millions of refugees are beginning to think about settling for good in the countries they find themselves in across Europe, posing a challenge to rebuilding the economy when the guns finally fall silent. Natalka Korzh, 52, a TV director and mother-of-two, left behind a newly-built dream house when she escaped the rockets falling on Kyiv in the early days of the war. She is only just finding her feet in Portugal, and doesn&#x27;t plan on packing up her life again even when fighting stops in Ukraine. Studies by the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR show the vast majority of displaced Ukrainians want to return one day, but only around one in ten plan to do so soon. In previous refugee crises, for example in Syria, refugees&#x27; desire to return home has faded with time, UNHCR studies show. Reuters spoke to four company bosses who said they are now grappling with the likelihood that many refugees will not return and that the workforce will keep shrinking for years to come, a situation also worrying demographers and the government. Volodymyr Kostiuk, CEO of Farmak, one of Ukraine&#x27;s top pharmaceutical companies, with nearly 3,000 employees and over 7 billion hryvnias ($200 million) in revenue the year before the war, said with so many people abroad, displaced within Ukraine or drafted into the armed forces he was facing a shortage in qualified laboratory workers and production specialists. A poll of about 500 businesses in Ukraine carried out by Ukrainian think-tank the Institute for Economic Research and Political Studies showed that a third saw staff shortages as a key challenge. Conscription-aged men are restricted from leaving Ukraine, so working-aged women, and children, make up the majority of refugees. While farms and factories have lost workers to the armed forces, labour shortages are especially acute in industries requiring higher levels of education and training because educated young women are among those most likely to have left the country since the war started in February 2022. Two thirds of the women who sought refuge elsewhere in Europe have a higher education, according to research published in March by Ukrainian think-tank the Centre for Economic Strategy. It&#x27;s not just a lack of labour, a shrinking workforce also dents consumer demand over the long term. Fozzy Group, which operates leading supermarket chains, reopened stores in areas around Kyiv following Russia&#x27;s retreat from the region in the first few months of fighting. But footfall is still low, said Dmytro Tsygankov, a Fozzy director in charge of new product lines. He said client visits were up in May compared to last year, but still 16% below May 2021, before the invasion. WILL THE MEN LEAVE? Ukraine&#x27;s population problem goes beyond millions of refugees. A high proportion of citizens are elderly, and the country&#x27;s fertility rate, already one of the lowest in the world, is believed to have fallen to 0.7 from 0.9 since war broke out, said Ella Libanova, one of the country&#x27;s most respected demographers, at the National Academy of Science. A million people are fighting the Russians, millions more live in territory seized by Moscow or have been displaced to Russia. The Ukrainian government does not release casualty figures, but in April leaked U.S. intelligence assessments  said 15,000 working age men had been killed or wounded. Many more are injured. Ksenia Karpenko, a 33-year-old Ukrainian fashion designer from Kyiv, shows her creation which represents Ukraine&#x27;s national culture, in Madrid, Spain, June 23, 2023. REUTERS/Juan Medina Libanova also warned that once wartime restrictions on men leaving the country were lifted many could join families abroad. With Russia now occupying about a fifth of the country&#x27;s territory, Libanova estimates the population in areas controlled by Kyiv could already be as low as 28 million, down from a government estimate of 41 million before the Feb. 24, 2022 invasion. The estimates exclude Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, which had around 2 million people at the start of that year. Even before the war, Ukraine&#x27;s population was shrinking. At independence in 1991, Ukraine had about 52 million people. A census in 2001 - the country&#x27;s only so far - recorded a population of 48.5 million. Depending on how long the fighting lasts, and how many people settle abroad, Ukraine&#x27;s population is set to decline further by between about a fifth and a third over the next 30 years, according a  study published in March by the European Commission&#x27;s Joint Research Centre. ECONOMIC IMPACT The government has not published figures for the current population, and even the best estimates allow a large margin of error to account for uncertainty about how many people are in Russia, Belarus and Russian-held territory. Demographer Libanova estimated the population at between 28 million and 34 million at the start of 2023 in parts of the country controlled by Kyiv. The Center for Economic Strategy estimated that between 860,000 and 2.7 million Ukrainians may remain abroad for good, based on a poll in February of more than a 1,000 refugees in EU countries. As a result, the economy could lose 2.55%-7.71% of its GDP per year, it said. Farmak CEO Kostiuk said some of his staff work remotely and that less than 5% of his employees had left and stayed abroad. But, he worries about a growing shortage of specialized workers, in part because young graduates lack practical skills after studying remotely through the pandemic and invasion. The government is more optimistic about returnees, citing the patriotism that surged after the invasion. Oleksiy Sobolev, deputy economy minister, told a recent roundtable he expected up to 75% of refugees would head back to Ukraine within three years of the end of fighting. Some Ukrainians overseas are supporting the economy remotely. Fashion designer Ksenia Karpenko has kept her business afloat from her current home in Tarragona on the Mediterranean coast in Spain, where she was on vacation when the war broke out. She had to downsize but kept going despite the war and now manages a team of eight people in Ukraine to design and make clothes sold in boutiques in Madrid and Barcelona.

Anastasia Taylor-Lind At the onset of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the world witnessed a massive exodus of refugees from the country. Photos of exhausted, fearful women queuing at the country's western borders, clutching children, waiting to cross to safety, have become iconic in international coverage of the war. Since then, more than 8 million Ukrainians have registered as refugees in Europe and another 5.3 million have become internally displaced, according to the U.N. refugee agency . But these statistics reflect only a small part of the struggle civilians are going through. With the insufficient financial resources and policies in place that, according to  scholars of international law , harm civilians and prevent families from reuniting, for most refugees, displacement has become not a single, lifesaving event but rather a chronic condition of uncertainty and precarity.

Anastasia Taylor-Lind hide caption toggle caption Anastasia Taylor-Lind Elena Diachkova was one of those early refugees. Her town of Avdiivka, in the eastern region of Donbas, instantly turned into a battlefield. She was forced to flee with her daughter, Yulia, and her then 2-year-old grandson, Nikita. The men of the family — Elena's and Yulia's husbands — stayed behind because Ukraine restricts men between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country. Elena, Yulia and Nikita found a new home in Poland. But this proved to be only the beginning of a new struggle. The family soon ran into financial hardship. Yulia, who, prior to the invasion, worked as an auditor, could only find a job planting trees in a local forestry. Elena tried her luck at a fish processing factory. The physically demanding jobs were not enough to make ends meet. Back in Ukraine, Elena's husband, Alexander, ended up unemployed as his workplace was destroyed in war. The only remaining salary of Yulia's husband was not enough to support the whole family abroad.

She was separated from baby Nikita, while Elena's relationship with Alexander, grew increasingly strained with no prospect of reunification in sight. A year after moving to Poland, Elena and Nikita recently returned to Ukraine. Theirs is a common trajectory over the past year. Even though European countries have offered an unusual degree of support and hospitality, for most Ukrainians, it was not enough to build a new life. Many Ukrainians abroad struggle financially, find it hard to integrate into host societies and, most importantly, suffer from being separated from their loved ones. Displaced women and children are mostly on their own, and families face the prospect of being split indefinitely.

Anastasia Taylor-Lind hide caption toggle caption Anastasia Taylor-Lind Those Ukrainians who do not cross international borders but are displaced internally often find themselves in similarly dire straits. Olga Grinik, together with her two young children, evacuated from Avdiivka in the eastern Donetsk region to a safer place in central Ukraine, while her husband joined the armed forces. The family pooled all its savings to buy a rundown, abandoned house in a village, and now Olga struggles to make it habitable while operating, essentially, as a single mother. In Ukraine, housing for people displaced by the war is scarce and inadequate. Most often, they are temporarily hosted in public facilities such as schools or kindergartens. Families like Olga's are often on their own to deal with their problems. As Ukraine struggles to fight a war of attrition against a stronger adversary, civilians displaced by the fighting feel they are low on the country's list of priorities. Internal refugees report to aid workers and journalists that when approaching authorities with their problems, they are often turned away and advised not to be selfish and to remember that soldiers on the front lines have it even worse.

Anastasia Taylor-Lind hide caption toggle caption Anastasia Taylor-Lind When in the summer of 2022 the shelling once again got dangerously close to her apartment building, she and her 11-year-old son, Danil, fled from the eastern Ukrainian town of Sloviansk. Upon arriving in Dnipro, the nearest big city, they faced the prospect of homelessness, as the shelter for displaced people could take them in only for a few nights. Eventually, they had to go back home. Soon, however, the fighting in Sloviansk intensified again, and they had to flee for their lives once more. They were caught up in a cycle of repeated displacement and return — a typical situation for many in Ukraine, aid agencies say. In a  recent report , the U.N. refugee agency describes the dynamics of border crossings in and out of Ukraine as \"pendular,\" noting that people tend to travel back and forth, rather than exclusively out of the country. Mirroring this definition are the hesitations of those Ukrainians who try to navigate the precarious dynamics of displacement and family separation.

Those who leave face moral scrutiny over their choice, and those who stay in towns on the front lines — and especially those who have lived under the Russian occupation — are stigmatized as possible collaborators and enemy sympathizers.

By Don Lee July 6, 2023  6 AM PT  Facebook Twitter Show more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Copy Link URL Copied! Print Below the radar of Washington’s highly partisan battles over the U.S.-Mexico border, employment gains for immigrant women in the U.S. are reaching record levels, thanks in part to a surge of Ukrainian refugees. Many are semi-skilled and highly motivated workers, entering the U.S. legally and through special emergency programs. They are not only easing intense  worker shortages in hospitality, retail and other service industries, but are helping drive up employment for the entire country. People born outside the U.S. make up just 17.5% of the American working-age population, but foreign-born workers 16 years and older accounted for a whopping 64% of the nation’s labor force growth in the two-year period that ended in May, with women making an outsized contribution, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Advertisement That compares with a 38% share in the five years to 2019 before the pandemic.  Politics DeSantis’ treatment of migrants divides Miami’s Venezuelan community, the nation’s largest Members of the country’s largest Venezuelan community in Miami have had mixed reactions to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ treatment of immigrants, including his decision to transport migrants to other states. Migrants from abroad have long been an expanding part of the U.S. labor market, offsetting an aging population and other drags on growth. But their labor participation relative to U.S.-born workers has accelerated further since coming out of the pandemic, thanks to a  rebound in normal legal immigration and the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees, most notably from Ukraine.  Adding to that are emerging social and economic conditions that are driving more immigrant women to work rather than stay at home.  Statistics now show that the labor participation rate of foreign-born women blew past record levels this year and has nearly caught up with that of U.S.-born women, whose numbers are still below pre-pandemic levels. “We’re already seeing immigration becoming increasingly important in supporting labor force growth, and it will  become even more important ,” said Julia Gelatt, a senior analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Advertisement Beyond filling employers’ immediate needs, these newcomers are expected to provide a critical cushion to a U.S. workforce hit by both short-term and longer-running forces:  retirements and a surge in workers quitting jobs post-pandemic; declining birthrates; and rising deaths, including  drug-related fatalities , suicides and other so-called deaths of despair. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, some 300,000 people from that war-torn country have arrived in the U.S., many under the Biden administration’s  “Uniting for Ukraine” program. About 100,000 Afghans have come since the fall of Kabul in late summer of 2021, and tens of thousands more from Venezuela and Cuba, among other countries, are being admitted for humanitarian reasons. Individuals entering under urgent refugee and parole programs can secure work permits relatively quickly. They can generally stay for at least two years. Some have come with university degrees and needed skills like nursing. Others are eagerly fillinglower-paying openings at restaurants, hotels, retail stores and nursing homes — jobs that U.S. citizens are largely passing up. Vita Bohera and Nadia Senkiv are from the Lviv region in western Ukraine. Sponsored by relatives in the U.S., the two distant cousins landed in Portland, Ore., at the end of August. By November, Bohera and Senkiv, who are both in their 30s, got work authorization papers. “I was just sitting at home thinking, ‘What am I going to do in this country?’” said Bohera, a university graduate who worked as an English teacher in Ukraine. She began browsing Facebook pages for job opportunities. After two months of training, Bohera found work as a medical interpreter, earning $20 to $40 an hour. Sometimes she drives long distances for appointments. “The company usually pays for mileage, which is great,” she said. Bohera came with her two children, ages 12 and 16, but not her husband. Most men in Ukraine are held back because of the potential call for military service. Senkiv, 31, does not have children but also left her husband in Ukraine and is staying with her younger brother, who has been in the U.S. for several years. Her path to employment was different. In her hometown of Drohobych, Senkiv attended vocational school after completing basic ninth-grade education. She worked for a company preparing dumplings and other ready-made foods. In Portland, she learned of a job opening from a woman attending the same Ukrainian church. Since March, Senkiv has been working as a full-time cook at a preschool in southeast Portland. She also has a second job, putting in two hours at night clearing tables and washing dishes at a senior living center for $14.75 an hour. Senkiv doesn’t make a lot more at the preschool, and she’s quickly learned of a common American irritant: “My salary is OK, but taxes are high.” Still, Senkiv says she is happy with her job — she loves working with kids. “The children like to hug. We don’t hug so much in Ukraine,” she said, her words translated by her cousin. World &amp; Nation Sleepless in Kyiv: In Ukraine’s capital, the stress of war weighs on everyone. How do people cope? How do citizens of Kyiv cope with the sleep deprivation and stress from Russia’s war on Ukraine? Some push it down, some try yoga or dancing. Working in the kitchen or at a senior facility are among  many service jobs that have gone begging, especially since the country has come out of the pandemic. Even amid modest economic growth, there were more than 10 million openings in the U.S. this spring — almost two jobs for every officially unemployed person, according to the latest government figures. Job vacancies were up more than 50% in healthcare and social assistance establishments compared with 2019 before the pandemic, and they were up 22% at lodging and food service businesses, where turnover is rampant. Rough estimates indicate that as many as 50,000 positions that include dishwashing duties may be available, based on job listings in Indeed. Immigrants make up an especially big part of the workforce at hotels and restaurants. Marriott International says it has hired more than 550 refugees in the U.S. since last year. It is one of a dozen companies in lodging, manufacturing, cleaning and other services that have pledged to hire 20,000 refugees over three years. “We’re in a unique moment, politically and economically,” said Yaron Schwartz, the U.S. director for Tent Partnership for Refugees, a nonprofit mobilizing companies to hire and train refugees. There are other reasons for the rise in labor participation among immigrant women. Like women overall, those foreign-born are increasingly better educated, which means they’re more likely to be working.  Economic pressures also are pushing traditional immigrant households to put stay-at-home moms into outside work, especially given the last couple of years of high inflation. “It’s almost a necessity,” said Naomi Cruz, a Glendale immigration attorney who had been the L.A. lead at the Latinista, a  group promoting careers and entrepreneurs among Latinas. Nearly one-third of Latinos in the U.S. are foreign-born. In more recent years Asia has been the leading source of immigrants, and among women, Census Bureau statistics show that those from India have seen the biggest employment gains, likely reflecting more spouses of tech workers with H-1B visas in the job market. Overall, net immigration to the U.S., including refugees, exceeded 1 million between 2021 and 2022. That was more than double the number in each of the prior two years, when the pandemic and other border-tightening policies under the Trump administration brought international migration to a decades low. Experts don’t expect such big increases in immigration in the years ahead because of caps under U.S. law, but various humanitarian programs allowing up to 30,000 people a month from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti and Nicaragua are likely to continue to boost the numbers. These and others from abroad are expected to become increasingly important for the labor force as the U.S. joins other advanced economies caught in a demographic squeeze. Especially for states like California, international migration is the difference between a growing or shrinking population, especially as many appear to be moving out of the state because of its high living costs.  Just how many of the refugees will reside in the U.S. and work beyond two years is unknown. Viktoriia Gorbachevska, 29, who quickly found work as a business analyst in Raleigh, N.C., since arriving from Ukraine in November after getting matched with a sponsor through  Welcome Connect, isn’t sure. But she sees a lot of potential to build a future in the U.S.  “This country is good for educated young people starting work here,” said Gorbachevska, who has a master’s degree and is married with two young children. The Biden administration has already made a way for Afghan nationals to extend their stay, and many refugees in general are expected to seek permanent status through asylum and other programs. Zakira, who asked that her last name not be used because of security concerns, fled Kabul on Aug. 19, 2021, just four days after the Taliban captured the capital city. “That day was hard for me,” Zakira said as she recalled working at a hospital as panic swept her family. “My dad called me. ‘Where are you? Why are you at work?’” Zakira, 26, and her 17-year-old sister first arrived in Qatar, then found transport to Washington, D.C. And after two months at a base in Texas, the two sisters settled in Portland. Zakira was a nurse in Afghanistan, and she initially found employment at a nursing home. Then at the end of last year, she left for a better-paying job at a hospital caring for patients. She is now getting training in phlebotomy. Her sister is attending high school, and the two live in a one-bedroom apartment in downtown Portland. In Kabul, they left behind their parents, as well as a brother and older sister married with children. Zakira said she fled because she wanted to get away from a regime that “ended the dreams” for girls and women wanting to go to school or pursue a career. “It’s good,” she said of opportunities in the U.S. “We can study, we can work. But it’s hard for me,” she added. “I have a plan, but without my family it’s hard. I don’t know. It’s hard for me.” Zakira said she will apply for asylum."

Ben Makuch July 8 2023, 6:00 a.m. Donate The founder of the Russian Volunteer Corps, Denis Kapustin, known as “White Rex,” is flanked by fighters in camouflage while attending a presentation for the media in northern Ukraine near the Russian border on May 24, 2023. Photo: Sergey Bobok/AFP via Getty Images In late May, an alliance of anti-Putin partisans used Ukrainian territory to launch a stunning incursion into western Russia. Spearheaded by the  Russian Volunteer Corps , or RVC, and its leader Denis Kapustin, a  wanted neo-Nazi  and ex-soccer hooligan, the assault exposed just how vulnerable Russia had become to attacks since its invasion of Ukraine. For years, Kapustin has maintained public links with two notorious American neo-Nazis:  Robert Rundo , the founder of the street fighting gang Rise Above Movement, and Christopher Pohlhaus, an ex-Marine and leader of a group that terrorizes drag events in the U.S. While Kapustin has been a regular fixture for years among  European  extremists, he gained minor popularity among American neo-Nazis when he started co-hosting a podcast in January 2021 with Rundo, a  Charlottesville riot defendant now facing extradition to the U.S. from Romania. On the multiepisode show, the two men — avid mixed martial artists —  discussed the benefits of “active clubs,” which are essentially fascist fight clubs that have sprouted up all over the U.S. But Kapustin, who also goes by his call sign “White Rex” (his  personal MMA brand ) or uses the last name “Nikitin,” has contacts that go further into stateside neo-Nazism. Join Our Newsletter Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. I&#039;m in In July 2021, he also appeared in another two-and-a-half hour podcast with Pohlhaus, a four-year veteran of the Marine Corps who only months ago, with a revolver strapped to his hip , led his so-called  Blood Tribe in a protest of a drag event outside Akron, Ohio. The relationship appears ongoing: Pohlhaus has told his followers on the Telegram app in recent weeks that he wants to help his friend “Denis” in Ukraine and plans to travel there to establish a neo-Nazi pipeline of volunteer soldiers to the cause. In the wake of Russian mercenary leader  Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mutiny against  President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s regime weeks ago, Kapustin illustrates just how radical some of the faces of armed opposition to Putin really are. Following RVC’s cross-border operations, which featured American-supplied Humvees and other armored vehicles,  reports rightly pointed out that the RVC and its politics could provide a boost for Russian propagandists who frequently accuse Kyiv of being a kind of Fourth Reich. Mostly composed of Russian ultranationalists with the stated goal of  overthrowing the Russian Federation , the RVC is undeniably affiliated with the far right, with members often seen wearing patches with neo-Nazi symbols. Kapustin is also a known figure to  German authorities , who allegedly had him  banned from the European Union’s Schengen area  for his violent neo-Nazism and connections to the extremist MMA scene. The Ukrainian government, for its part, has repeatedly maintained that the RVC isn’t officially part of its war effort or under its control, though the government admitted that it cooperates with and feeds intelligence to the controversial Russian partisans Pohlhaus, known to his followers as “The Hammer,” has recently emerged as one of the more public and militant figures in the world of online American neo-Nazism. With confirmed links to Riley June Williams, the  January 6 attacker who allegedly stole a laptop from Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s office, Pohlhaus moved to Maine last year and  began building a property for an all-white community where his Blood Tribe could “train.” This year, Pohlhaus and his group made headlines for twice showing up to drag events in Ohio and allying with NSC-131, another  underground neo-Nazi group  based in New England that recently threatened a New Hampshire drag story hour . At his  last Ohio protest in April at a fundraiser for LGBTQ+ youth in Columbus, Pohlhaus, who never saw combat as a Marine,  paced with his masked followers as they waved a swastika flag and  did the “Sieg Heil” salute to eventgoers.

Photo: Roman Pilipey/Getty Images Anti-Putin Fighters Though he previously showed little interest in the war in Ukraine, Pohlhaus told his followers this week, in both an interview on an underground neo-Nazi podcast and in a lengthy message on Telegram, that now was the time to join the war and help neo-Nazis like Kapustin.

Ryan Grim Russian Militia Has Links to American Neo-Nazi and Anti-Trans Figures Ben Makuch This Week, America Failed to Get Josh Hawley to Feel Shame Jon Schwarz “I will be going personally with a squad of mostly vets who have committed to the task,” Pohlhaus wrote in a message viewed thousands of times on Telegram, explaining that “if everything goes correctly,” he would become the “[neo-Nazi] liaison for the anglosphere in Ukraine.” “We see the glorious opportunity in this conflict,” said Pohlhaus. “Because the American military is staying out of it, we get the chance to participate [under] OUR banner.” Though Pohlhaus has been known for grandstanding online, he is an extremist who translates his words into activism: He once organized a national counterprotest  on the anniversary of George Floyd’s murder and explained how to hypothetically use  sniper attacks on the food supply chain in a streamed video. He told The Intercept that his pledge to join the fighting in Ukraine is serious. “I love Denis and I want to do everything I can to help him succeed,” Pohlhaus wrote in a text message. “It&#8217;s going to probably take us a couple years to be there equipped.” He claimed that he will visit Ukraine to assess the situation firsthand. “Of course,” he said. “A vacation.” Related Foreign Fighters in Ukraine Could Be a Time Bomb for Their Home Countries Whether Pohlhaus would be allowed entry into Ukraine is another question. With an ongoing civilian flight ban in Ukraine, Pohlhaus would have to enter the country through bordering nations like Poland, the  usual border of entry for foreign volunteers, or Romania, a country that has recently  shown a willingness to arrest extremists  from abroad. Both countries are in the NATO alliance, with policing and intelligence apparatuses that cooperate with U.S. authorities. The Ukrainians, for their part, have shown very little interest in allowing neo-Nazis like Pohlhaus to join their war effort. As far back as October 2020, Ukrainian intelligence  made a public show  of deporting two American members of neo-Nazi terrorist group Atomwaffen Division. Both men (one of whom was a  Marine dropout ) were attempting to join elements of the country’s military efforts in the eastern Donbas region, which at the time was the site of trench warfare with pro-Russian forces. Kacper Rekawek, an expert on the flow of foreign fighters to the war in Ukraine and a nonresident research fellow at the  Counter Extremism Project , says that while there are neo-Nazis from abroad in Ukraine, the problem shouldn’t be overblown. “It&#8217;s certainly not as bad as the Russian propaganda wants us to believe,” said Rekawek. “The caution is warranted, and what I see is there is excitement amongst those far-right types, online and offline.” According to Rekawek, there are very few neo-Nazi foreigners fighting on the front lines, while groups like CasaPound in Italy, another fascist and nationalist political organization, have sent “observation” missions to Ukraine. “Some of them take some supplies, they&#8217;re usually medical, or some tactical gear, but of course, not weapons,” Rekawek said, who added that “talk of a pipeline” of neo-Nazis into the war is exaggerated. While groups like the RVC have called for new recruits, non-Russian- and Ukrainian-speaking foreigners who once joined the war in droves, regardless of political ideology, don’t typically last on the front lines, nor can they be trained as effectively for combat. “The capacity of these guys to offer meaningful change on the front lines is limited,” said Rekawek, referring to far-right travelers operating within the Ukrainian war effort. “These organizations are no charity, they&#8217;re not there to train you.” There were initial fears among counterterrorism experts that the war in Ukraine could potentially attract a global movement of neo-Nazis, leading to the formation of an Islamic State-like network. But a year and half into the war, most authorities acknowledge that Ukraine  hasn’t yet become a destination for the far-right movement. Nonetheless, American law enforcement officials have voiced serious concerns about people like Pohlhaus traveling to Ukraine, fighting in the war, and then coming home. At the outset of the invasion in March 2022, an internal Customs and Border Protection  report warned that American extremists interrogated at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York before their departure flights were on their way to “join the conflict.” The bulletin openly wondered what kinds of skills those types of “foreign fighters” could learn in Ukraine that could then “proliferate&#8221; in “U.S.-based militia and white nationalist groups” once they returned home. Whatever the outcome of his latest call to volunteer for the conflict, or if it&#8217;s simply a bluff to attract more funding to his  personal cause , Pohlhaus acknowledged it could be a while before the Blood Tribe appears in Ukraine. He told his followers that it would take time to pool resources and even vehicles in order to be autonomous on the front lines. “At the end of the day, this is very much Ukraine&#8217;s issue,” said Rekawek, who thinks that far-right elements within the Ukrainian military structure could be a problem when it comes to European Union or NATO membership for the country. “It&#8217;s up to Ukraine to call the shots. And it will certainly be an issue, but further down the line.”"

REUTERS/Aleksandra Szmigiel Summary Russia marks Victory Day over Nazis on May 9 Zelenskiy says he will move anniversary to May 8 Move would align Ukraine with Western countries KYIV, May 8 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy moved on Monday to formalise the day that Ukraine marks the allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two as May 8, aligning it with Western nations in a repudiation of the Soviet past quickly condemned by Moscow. Speaking to Ukrainians on a hill overlooking Kyiv, Zelenskiy said &quot;the old evil&quot; had returned, this time waged by a &quot;modern Russia&quot; pursuing the same goal as the Nazis of &quot;enslavement and destruction&quot; - but that it would not succeed. Zelenskiy said he had submitted a bill to parliament officially making May 8 Ukraine&#x27;s day of remembrance and victory, while May 9 would become Europe Day. Zelenskiy wants Ukraine one day, after the war, to join the European Union. Nazi Germany&#x27;s unconditional surrender came into force at 11:01 p.m. on May 8, 1945, which was already May 9 in Moscow. Russia marks the day on May 9, a key national event with huge military parades and commemorations of the enormous sacrifices made by the then-Soviet Union, which lost some 27 million citizens in defeating Nazi Germany. Ukraine first moved the commemoration to May 8 in 2015, accusing Russia, which had annexed Crimea and fuelled an insurgency in its east the year before, of using the anniversary to whip up Russian nationalism. But it did not formalise the change for fear of stoking internal divisions. The Kremlin said May 9 would remain sacred for many in Ukraine. Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova went further. Moscow has stepped up attacks on Ukrainian cities including the capital Kyiv in the leadup to May 9, and some commentators say President Vladimir Putin wants to secure some kind of victory in the grinding war to coincide with the holiday.

The Kremlin had hoped for a quick “special military operation” but 16-and-a-half months later, fighting is still raging with no immediate end in sight.

From Feb. 24, 2022 to May 21, 2023, 8,895 civilians have been recorded as killed and 15,117 injured, according to the  , which said it believed the actual figures were considerably higher. As many  as 354,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or injured, according to a trove of purported U.S. intelligence documents posted online. Ukraine has not said how many of its soldiers have been killed. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Sept. 21 that 5,937 Russian soldiers had been killed since the start of the war. No further updates have been given. Both Ukraine and Russia say the other side has sustained devastatingly high casualties. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield claims from either side. Western diplomats told Reuters that Russia&#x27;s deaths and casualties totalled around 200,000. Russia&#x27;s  Shoigu said that 16,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been lost in May alone. Russia&#x27;s most powerful mercenary, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said that 72,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the 8-month &quot;meat grinder&quot; of Bakhmut. Wagner, he said, had recruited around 50,000 convicts during the war, of whom about 20% had perished. Around the same amount of his contract soldiers -  10,000 - had perished , he said. Kyiv says Russia&#x27;s casualties in Bakhmut are far bigger than its own. The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine&#x27;s Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, with Russian-backed separatist forces fighting Ukraine&#x27;s armed forces. About 14,000 people were killed there between 2014 and the end of 2021,  according to OHCHR , including 3,106 civilians. * MISERY Since the 2022 invasion, millions of Ukrainians have been forced from their homes, the United Nations refugee agency has said. Ukraine has a population of more than 41 million. An  estimated 17.6 million people in Ukraine require urgent humanitarian support, including  more than 5  million people internally displaced by the war, the  UNHCR said There are over 8 million refugees from Ukraine recorded across Europe, with the biggest numbers in Russia, Poland, and Germany, according to the  agency&#x27;s data . Russia has 2.9 million registered Ukrainian refugees. * UKRAINE Ukraine has lost control of at  least 17-18% of its land to Russia, including a swathe of coastline. Its economy has been crippled and some cities have been turned into wastelands by the fighting. Ukraine&#x27;s economy contracted by 30% in 2022 and is projected to contract by another 3% in 2023, according to the International Monetary Fund. Ukraine&#x27;s reconstruction and recovery will cost $411 billion over the next decade, according to a  joint assessment by Ukraine, the World Bank Group, the European Commission, and the United Nations. It is unclear how much Ukraine has spent on the fighting. * RUSSIA Russia&#x27;s expenditure on the war is a state secret, but it coincides with a major shock to the Russian economy from the toughest ever Western sanctions imposed after the invasion. The economy defied early expectations for a double-digit contraction in 2022, but a return to prosperity remains a long way off as the government directs more spending towards the military. Russia&#x27;s economy ministry expects GDP growth of at least 1.2% this year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts 2023 growth of 0.7% and expects global isolation and lower energy revenues to dampen Russia&#x27;s prospects for years to come. As Russia&#x27;s military spending soars and sanctions squeeze its energy revenues, Moscow faces a battle to keep its  budget deficit in check. Russia has lost a major chunk of the European gas market but has been able to keep selling its oil to global markets. It has been excluded from Western financial markets, most of its oligarchs are sanctioned, and it is experiencing problems sourcing some items such as microchips. Russia has  defaulted on its foreign bonds for the first time since the calamitous months following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. * PRICES The invasion and Western sanctions on Russia led to steep rises in the prices of fertiliser, wheat, metals and energy, fuelling an inflationary wave and a global food crisis. Russia is the world&#x27;s second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the world&#x27;s biggest exporter of natural gas, wheat, nitrogen fertiliser and palladium. Shortly after Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, international oil prices spiked to their highest levels since the records of 2008. The IMF said in April that the  dislocations to the energy and food markets caused by the war were receeding. * WESTERN WEAPONS Since the invasion, the United States has  committed more than $37.6 billion in  security assistance to Ukraine, including stinger anti-aircraft systems, Javelin anti-armour systems, 155mm Howitzers and equipment to protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attack. The biggest overall supporters of Ukraine in nominal terms are the United States, the European Union, Britain, Germany and Japan, according to  The Kiel Institute for the World Economy Russia says the West&#x27;s weapons supplies are escalating the war. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has said that the  West has been encouraging the war by arming Ukraine. China has refused to condemn Russia and says it is seeking  peace Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Philippa Fletcher"

Russian soldiers wait for the speech of President Putin at the Kremlin [File: Sergei Guneyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP] Published On 10 Jul 2023 10 Jul 2023 Nearly 50,000 Russian men have died in the war in Ukraine, according to the first independent statistical analysis of Russia’s war dead. Two independent Russian media outlets, Mediazona and Meduza, working with a data scientist from Germany’s Tübingen University, used Russian government data to shed light on one of Moscow’s closest-held secrets — the true human cost of its invasion of Ukraine. To do so, they relied on a statistical concept popularised during the COVID-19 pandemic called excess mortality. Drawing on inheritance records and official mortality data, they estimated how many more men below the age of 50 died between February 2022 and May 2023 than normal. Neither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each is at pains to amplify the other side’s casualties. Russia has publicly acknowledged the deaths of just about 6,000 soldiers. A building destroyed by a Russian air attack, in Orikhiv, Zaporizhia region, Ukraine [Head of the Zaporizhia Regional Military Administration Yurii Malashko/Telegram/Handout via Reuters] Reports about military losses have been repressed in Russian media, activists and independent journalists say. Documenting the dead has become an act of defiance, and those who do so face harassment and potential criminal charges. Despite such challenges, Mediazona and BBC News Russian, working with a network of volunteers, have used social media postings and photographs of cemeteries across Russia to build a database of confirmed war deaths. As of July 7, they had identified 27,423 dead Russian soldiers. “These are only soldiers who we know by name, and their deaths in each case are verified by multiple sources,” said Dmitry Treshchanin, an editor at Mediazona who helped oversee the investigation. “The estimate we did with Meduza allows us to see the ‘hidden’ deaths, deaths the Russian government is so obsessively and unsuccessfully trying to hide.” To come up with a more comprehensive tally, journalists from Mediazona and Meduza obtained records of inheritance cases filed with the Russian authorities. Their data from the National Probate Registry contained information about more than 11 million people who died between 2014 and May 2023. According to their analysis, 25,000 more inheritance cases were opened in 2022 for males aged 15 to 49 than expected. By May 27, 2023, the number of excess cases had shot up to 47,000. That surge is roughly in line with a May assessment by the White House that more than 20,000 Russians had been killed in Ukraine since December, though lower than the US and UK intelligence assessments of overall Russian deaths. In February, the UK Ministry of Defence said approximately 40,000 to 60,000 Russians had likely been killed in the war. A leaked assessment from the US Defense Intelligence Agency put the number of Russians killed in action in the first year of the war at 35,000 to 43,000. “Their figures might be accurate, or they might not be,” Treshchanin, the Mediazona editor, said in an email. “Even if they have sources in the Russian Ministry of Defence, its own data could be incomplete. It’s extremely difficult to pull together all of the casualties from the army, Rosgvardia, Akhmat battalion, various private military companies, of which Wagner is the largest, but not the only one. Casualties among inmates, first recruited by Wagner and now by the MoD, are also a very hazy subject, with a lot of potential for manipulation. Statistics could actually give better results.” Many Russian deaths – as well as amputations – could have been prevented with better front-line first aid, the UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence assessment published on Monday. Russia has suffered an average of about 400 casualties a day for 17 months, creating a “crisis” in combat medical care that is likely undermining medical services for civilians in border regions near Ukraine, the ministry said. Independently, Dmitry Kobak, a data scientist from Tübingen University who has published work on excess COVID-19 deaths in Russia, obtained mortality data broken down by age and sex for 2022 from Rosstat, Russia’s official statistics agency. He found that 24,000 more men below the age of 50 died in 2022 than expected, a figure that aligns with the analysis of inheritance data. The COVID-19 pandemic made it harder to figure out how many men would have died in Russia since February 2022 if there had not been a war. Both analyses corrected for the lingering effects of COVID on mortality by indexing male death rates against female deaths. Sergei Scherbov, a scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, cautioned that “differences in the number of deaths between males and females can vary significantly due to randomness alone”. “I am not saying that there couldn’t be an excess number of male deaths, but rather that statistically speaking, this difference in deaths could be a mere outcome of chance,” he said. Russians who are missing but not officially recognised as dead, as well as citizens of Ukraine fighting in units of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics, are not included in these counts. Kobak acknowledged that some uncertainties remain, especially regarding the deaths of older men. Moreover, it is hard to know how many missing Russian soldiers are actually dead. But he said neither factor is likely to have a huge effect. “That uncertainty is in the thousands,” he said. “The results are plausible overall.” The Russian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meduza is an independent Russian media outlet that has been operating in exile for eight years, with headquarters in Riga, Latvia. In April 2021, Russian authorities designated Meduza a “foreign agent”, making it harder to generate advertising income, and in January 2023, the Kremlin banned it as an illegal “undesirable organisation”. Moscow has also labelled independent outlet Mediazona as a “foreign agent” and blocked its website after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine."

      "Text": "Wagner Cost Russia Suspiciously Little Money Analysis by  Leonid Bershidsky | Bloomberg July 4, 2023 at 3:19 a.m. EDT Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share In the aftermath of the failed mutiny by the Wagner Group mercenary army and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, dissatisfaction with Russia’s military and political leadership will continue to brew with the fighting in Ukraine. As more details become available about Wagner — until recently, the best-equipped, always regularly paid part of the Russian invasion force — officers and soldiers alike will wonder why their units often need to rely on public collections for vital equipment and why their pay is oftendelayed or reduced. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Vladimir Putin’s Russia is known for its ability to fight wars on a relatively small budget. The war in Ukraine is no exception. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Russia’s military spending was about 4.4% of gross domestic product in 2022 and should not exceed that by much this year. Israelspent 4.5% of its GDP on defense last year.  The headline number doesn’t include indirect war-related outlays, such as on construction in occupied areas and in Russian border regions damaged by Ukrainian shelling. But it’s a manageable amount. SIPRI has this to say in areport published last week: Advertisement For Ukraine, it is without question a full-scale war for the country’s very existence as an independent state. But Russia has been engaged in the conflict in a more limited manner, as if seeking to minimize its economic cost and the impact on domestic society and on the president’s goals for the country. It is being fought in reality not with the resources of a full-scale war but indeed as a more limited military operation... it is an operation being fought in monetary terms at a cost that the Russian economy can afford, notwithstanding severe sanctions. The low financial cost of the war may be a major reason why Putin appears to believe that time is on his side and why he isn’t actively seeking peace in Ukraine. However, the tight budget appears to have been spent rather inefficiently compared with how Wagner put to use its government funding. At a meeting with service members last week, Putin said Wagner’s participation in the Ukraine invasion was fully financed by the Russian government. From May 2022 through April 2023, it was funded to the tune of 70.4 billion rubles ($786 million) for regular pay, 15.9 billion rubles for bonuses and 100.2 billion rubles for “insurance payments,” meaning compensation for deaths and injuries. Putin didn’t say how much was spent on Wagner’s equipment and ammunition, but the numbers he gave are revealing. Advertisement For one, they appear to be insufficient for the group’s reported size. In March, the UK Defense Ministryestimated Wagner had 50,000 fighters in Ukraine. Prigozhin himself said in May that he had 35,000 fighters on the front lines. In addition, he was allowed to recruit 50,000 convicts from prison camps. According to Prigozhin, 20% of the former prisoners — that is, about 10,000 — and an equal number of mercenaries were killed in action. Some 20% of both groups were wounded and unable to keep fighting. Prigozhin’s estimates suggest that, on average, some 20,000 mercenaries and some 30,000 convicts were fighting for Wagner at any given moment. If Putin’s figures are correct, each of the 50,000 fighters received about 144,000 rubles ($1,608) a month. That’s less than even the 200,000 rubles that convicts werepromised by Wagner, not to mention the minimum salaries of 240,000 rubles and monthly bonuses of 150,000 rubles offered to volunteers at the private military company’s recruitment offices throughout Russia.  Meanwhile, the “insurance” payments are closer to Prigozhin’s assessment of about 20,000 dead and 17,000 badly wounded. Wagnerpaid between 1.1 million rubles and 5.1 million rubles to the family of a fallen mercenary or convict and between 500,000 rubles and 2 million rubles for a severe injury. Putin’s 100.2 billion rubles for “insurance” would have meant an average of 2.7 million rubles per casualty. Advertisement In other words, if Putin’s spending numbers are correct, it’s likely that Prigozhin overstated the size of his army. Indeed, it would be in his interest to do so, inflating Wagner’s importance as the Defense Ministry sought to disband the group. But Prigozhin didn’t seem to stray too far from the truth on casualties as he highlighted the heavy price his mercenary army paid for the relatively insignificant victories at the towns of Soledar and Bakhmut. This would partially explain the failure of the mutiny: Prigozhin’s force was decimated by the losses from urban fighting in Ukraine, so only a few thousand fighters could move on Moscow while a few thousand more patrolled the center of Rostov on June 24. If no more than 30,000 Wagner soldiers — 10,000 professionals and 20,000 convicts -- fought in Ukraine in any given month, it’s clear where the money went and why so little was required. The Defense ministry’s math looks murkier. Its contract soldiers are supposed to receive a one-time sign-on bonus of 195,000 rubles and a minimum of 162,000 rubles a month afterwards. At some 210,000 rubles per month, a Russian military force of 200,000 in Ukraine (UK Defense Ministryestimate) would cost some 504 billion rubles per year, not counting payments to wounded vets and families. That is a mere 20% of the Russia’s defense ministry’s 2.54 trillion ruble budget allocation for the Russian armed forces in 2023, which only includes direct spending on maintaining Russia’s main fighting force (and none of the funding set aside for other armed units such as the Rosgvardia national guard, also present in Ukraine). The total Russian defense and security budget in 2023 is expected to reach 6.65 trillion rubles. Advertisement No NATO country spends less than 30% of its defense budget on personnel. Turkey’s personnel expenses hover near half of its military budget, and the US, which is usually at war somewhere, pays out between 35% and 45% for its service members. According to SIPRI, classified “national defense” spending reached 2 trillion rubles between Jan. 1 and May 11 — some 59% of the classified spending budgeted for the entire year, which is not unusual since defense industry contractors’ payments tend to be weighted heavily toward the first months of the year. It’s not as if the defense ministry lacks the money to pay soldiers regularly and almost as well as Prigozhin paid his supposedly elite force. And yet service members and their families  regularlycomplain of lapsed payments. Unlike Wagner fighters, mobilized and volunteer soldiers often have to buy their own equipment or rely on supplies from volunteer groups.  The Kremlin is happy that it’s able to keep military spending under control, but even the existing outlay allows for plenty of inefficiency and corruption. That’s the part visible to the soldiers and officers on the ground; after Putin publicly named Wagner’s costs, Wagner’s legend of deadly efficiency can only grow in comparison with what regular soldiers know about the defense ministry’s practices. Wagner’s death rate, shown by the same numbers to be higher than Prigozhin had let on, likely will not affect that legend or damp the anger among Russian service members — if only because both the mercenaries and the convicts knew what they were in for when they signed up for Wagner.  Advertisement It’s much harder for the regular military to riot than it was for Prigozhin’s mercenaries. Yet the example can be infectious, especially if Russia suffers more setbacks on the battlefield.More From Bloomberg Opinion: • Russia’s Mutiny Should Terrify Iran and China: Niall Ferguson • What Ukraine Needs Most Right Now Is Ammo: Hal Brands • Russia’s Mutiny Is Over and Done With.

At the start of the war, Ukrainian soldiers defending Snake Island famously defied an order from a Russian warship to surrender.  The Black Sea island was seized by Russia, but later reclaimed by Ukraine.  In a video, the Ukrainian president called it a &quot;place of victory&quot; that would never be reconquered. In the undated clip, posted on Telegram, Mr Zelensky described it as proof that Ukraine would return every inch of its territory taken by Russia since the full-scale invasion began on 24 February 2022.  The Ukrainian president later announced he had returned from a visit to Turkey with five commanders captured by the Russians during last year&#x27;s siege of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. They had been in Turkey since September 2022 after being freed from Russian captivity as part of a wider prisoner exchange. The circumstances of their homecoming are unclear, as the original deal obliged them to remain in Turkey. Image source,  EPA Image caption,  The president&#x27;s press service released pictures of him greeting the commanders in Istanbul Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agency RIA that Moscow had not been notified of the prisoner release, Reuters news agency reported. Mr Peskov said the prisoner release came about because of pressure on Turkey from Nato ahead of a meeting next week. Front-line troops discuss counter-offensive Biden defends decision to send Ukraine controversial weapons Russia&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet flagship Moskva sailed to Snake Island within hours of the start of the war and ordered Ukrainian soldiers on the island to give themselves up. The Ukrainian response and verbal exchange went viral as a soldier replied telling the Russian warship to &quot;go to hell&quot; - although in far cruder language.  Snake Island was seized and the Ukrainian soldiers were taken prisoner - but  later exchanged for Russian captives Ukrainian forces recaptured the island in June last year. The  UN estimates more than 9,000 civilians, including some 500 children, have been killed since the war began, although it said the real number could be much higher. Mr Zelensky made his video address after spending time visiting European leaders ahead of Nato&#x27;s summit in Vilnius next week where the Ukraine war is expect to be high on the agenda. He also welcomed the news that  the US would be supplying Ukraine with cluster bombs - a weapon that has been banned in more than 120 countries because they have a record of killing civilians. Both Ukraine and Russia have been using cluster munitions throughout the war, but the US&#x27;s decision has proved controversial. Ukraine&#x27;s long-awaited counter-offensive to retake territory from Russia&#x27;s occupying forces began last month - although Mr Zelensky has admitted progress has been slow. The effort has been focused in the eastern Donetsk and south-eastern Zaporizhzhia regions of the country, while there have also been slow advances in the city of Bakhmut. Russia, meanwhile, has carried on its campaign of missile and drone attacks in Ukraine, with  at least eight people killed in the eastern Donetsk city of Lyman on Saturday. Lyman is a key railway hub and initially fell to Russia after the invasion, but was retaken by Ukraine&#x27;s army in October."

      "Text": "Ukraine live briefing: Zelensky uses Snake Island to mark 500 days of war; nations oppose Biden’s cluster munitions shipment By  Kelsey Ables Victoria Bisset David L. Stern Shera Avi-Yonah and Andrea Salcedo Updated July 8, 2023 at 2:01 p.m. EDT Published July 8, 2023 at 1:09 a.m. EDT Listen 8 min Gift Article Share As Russia’s war in Ukraine reaches 500 days, Zelensky used Snake Island to rally Ukrainians. “I want to thank this place, a place of victory, every one of our fighters for these five hundred days,” he  said in a video posted early Saturday that showed him at the island, a small speck of land that to many Ukrainians has come to symbolize their resistance against Russia’s invasion. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Britain joined Germany in distancing itself from the U.S. decision to supply Ukraine with cluster munitions on Saturday, as Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov  tweeted a clarification and assurances about Ukraine’s use of  the controversial weapons . Canada also opposed the shipment, saying it is committed to ending the use of such weapons. President Biden defended the move to supply Kyiv with cluster munitions on Friday, telling reporters that Ukraine is “ running out of ammunition .” Here’s the latest on the war and its ripple effects across the globe. Key developments In the undated video, Zelensky described Snake Island as “proof that Ukraine will regain every bit of its territory.”  The island was captured by Russian forces in the early days of the war — with its Ukrainian border guards responding to demands they surrender with profanity. The moment was hailed as a rallying moment in Ukraine’s defense — and Russia’s  withdrawal  a few months later was seen as a symbolic victory for Kyiv. Zelensky regularly publishes videos as part of his messaging efforts and has previously released similar videos, often self-shot , to rally Ukrainians during key milestones of the war. Reznikov said Ukraine would not use cluster munitions in urban areas  and would keep strict records of their use. The munitions would save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers and would not be used within Russia’s borders,  he added Ukrainian troops have “trapped” Russian forces in the eastern town of Bakhmut, Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Saturday, as she also acknowledged 500 days of war.  Maliar said  Ukrainian forces had advanced more than one kilometer (0.6 miles) to the south of the town, which fell to Russian control in May after months of bloody fighting, while British Defense Ministry said in  its daily update Saturday that Ukraine had made “steady gains to both the north and south” of the city. Reaction to cluster munitions Russia’s ambassador to the United States said that the weapons allotment was a “gesture of despair”  and that American involvement will “only lead to more casualties and prolong the agony of the Kiev regime.” “Washington has ignored the negative opinions of its allies regarding the perils of the use of indiscriminate cluster munitions,” Ambassador Anatoly Antonov  posted  Friday on Telegram. European officials said they would not be sending such weapons to Ukraine . Britain’s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, when asked by reporters about the U.S. decision, stressed that their countries are among the more than 120 nations that signed a treaty banning the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of cluster munitions. The United States, Ukraine and Russia are not parties to the treaty. Spanish foreign minister Margarita Robles took a firmer line, telling reporters “no to cluster bombs and yes to the legitimate defense of Ukraine, which we understand should not be carried out with cluster bombs,” she said, per  the BBC Canada also opposed the U.S. shipment of cluster munitions,  John Babcock, a spokesman for Global Affairs Canada, said in an email to The Post. Babcock cited the  international treaty prohibiting the weapons, which Canada is a party to, though the United States is not. “We do not support the use of cluster munitions and are committed to putting an end to the effects cluster munitions have on civilians — particularly children,” Babcock said. Human rights groups criticized the U.S. move on cluster munitions,  describing the weapons, which can leave behind unexploded ordnance that can kill years after a conflict ends, as a “ grave threat to civilian lives ” that “ would inevitably cause long-term suffering .” Battleground updates Poland has moved more than 1,000 troops toward its border with Belarus in an effort to thwart destabilization , Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak  said  Saturday on Twitter. Belarus, one of the Kremlin’s last allies in the region, has worried NATO member Poland recently: On Sunday, Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski  tweeted  that he was sending 500 riot and counterterror police to the border region. Five commanders who defended the Azov steel plant in Mariupol  accompanied Zelensky to Ukraine from Turkey , where they were transferred after being captured by Russia in spring 2022. The men were supposed to stay in Turkey until the end of the war as part of the terms of a larger prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine,  Zelensky said in December , but returned home after an apparent renegotiation between Ukraine and Erdogan. Crowds in Lviv  greeted the motorcade of the returning Azov leaders accompanied by Zelensky. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the decision to send Azov leaders back to Ukraine from Turkey violated the agreement, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Nobody informed Russia about the transfer of the leaders of the Azov terrorist group from Turkey to Ukraine, Peskov told RIA Novosti. At least eight people were killed in Russian shelling in the eastern Ukrainian town of Lyman,  according to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. Five others were injured in the attack, the ministry  wrote on Telegram on Saturday. Shelling in Russia’s Belgorod region hit a market close to the Ukrainian border, injuring two people, Belgorod’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said Saturday.  He said one of the shells started a fire, and later added that  two people were injured. Belgorod has seen several attacks by anti-Russian forces in recent months,  according to local officials Shells hit a building in Zaporizhzhia on Friday, home to several major industrial sites and a nuclear plant that has become  a focus of worry over potential Russian attempts to cause a radiation leak. Regional governor Yurii Malashko  said on Telegram that no residents were injured in Friday’s strike, though a building caught fire. Global impact Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed support for Ukraine’s NATO bid on Friday telling reporters: “There is no doubt that Ukraine deserves NATO membership.” Turkey has  maintained a complicated balancing act  during the conflict — supporting Ukraine but also being reluctant to support Western sanctions on Russia, while helping to broker agreements to export Ukrainian grain. Turkey is also  holding up Sweden’s bid to join the NATO alliance, saying it is unhappy  with Stockholm’s treatment of what it calls Kurdish militants. Despite Zelensky’s last-minute appeals, “Ukraine will not be joining NATO” at the alliance’s upcoming summit in Lithuania,  Sullivan said at a briefing on Friday. However, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said separately that he expects the bloc’s leaders to reaffirm at the summit “ that Ukraine will become a member of NATO ” and “unite on how to bring Ukraine closer to its goal.” The U.N. aid chief said the Black Sea grain deal, which Russia has threatened to abandon, “isn’t something you chuck away,”  while speaking to  reporters Friday. The deal has facilitated the export of millions of tons of grain and foodstuffs supporting global food security, according to the United Nations, and is  set to expire in mid-July unless it is renewed. U.N. Secretary General António Guterres reiterated the “importance of full and continued implementation of the agreements” in a statement released Friday. Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, met Friday with Evan Gershkovich’s family members and Wall Street Journal colleagues  to mark the U.S. journalist’s 100th day of detention in Russia.  Gershkovich is being held on espionage charges that he, his employer and rights groups unequivocally deny, and the United States considers him to be wrongfully detained. From our correspondents Kremlin smears Wagner boss Prigozhin, hailing Putin as Russia’s savior :  The Kremlin’s propaganda apparatus is in overdrive working to discredit Wagner mercenary boss Yevgeniy Prigozhin and to cast President Vladimir Putin as the wise leader who saved Russia from civil war, Robyn Dixon reports. But even as the state-controlled media is trashing Prigozhin as a greedy, treasonous opportunist, the Kremlin has permitted him to return to Russia and recover millions in cash and personal weapons, showing that it’s not so easy to make him disappear. Still, the gaslighting efforts seem to be working, putting Russia’s shocked population back into passive mode and portraying Putin as stronger than ever. “As far as the general public is concerned, it seems like clinging to normalcy is still the most common and the most immediate reaction among the majority,” said Maria Lipman, a Russia analyst at George Washington University."

Ukraine&#x27;s president has yet to confirm his attendance amid suggestions that he may snub the alliance’s invitation to appear at the meeting in Lithuania. Biden visits U.K. ahead of NATO summit in Lithuania 04:57 Get more news Live on NBC News Now Print July 10, 2023, 3:11 PM UTC By  Yuliya Talmazan and  Alexander Smith LONDON — The big question hanging over  the high-profile NATO summit this week  is whether Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy will show up.  The answer could either prove a galvanizing moment for the West in its support of  Kyiv against Russia , or a humiliation. Though invited, Zelenskyy has yet to confirm his attendance,  with his officials saying he is not yet clear about what was being promised at the summit.  Zelenskyy’s last-minute decision shines a spotlight on the divisions between Kyiv and its foreign backers as the war passes its 500th day The central disagreement:  whether to invite Ukraine to join NATO , and, if so, when and how. The two-day summit opens Tuesday in Lithuania, a former Soviet republic that today is one of the most outspoken critics of Russia’s war in Ukraine.  President Joe Biden,  who stopped in London on Monday en route to Vilnius , the Lithuanian capital, has said he doesn’t think Ukraine is ready for full NATO membership.  Biden told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria that discussion around Ukraine imminently joining NATO was premature, but he said the U.S. and its allies in NATO would continue to provide Kyiv with weaponry and support to end the war. “I don’t think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war,” Biden said.  Ukraine's joining NATO as the war rages, in the eyes of the U.S. and other allies such as Germany, would risk a full-blown conflict with a  nuclear-armed Russia. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Getty Images file As national security adviser Jake Sullivan said at a briefing Friday: Biden “has been clear that we are going to support Ukraine for as long as it takes,” but “we are not seeking to start World War III.” NATO’s central pillar is  Article 5 — the “all for one and one for all” clause that suggests allies, and namely the colossal U.S. military, will come to the aid of any fellow member that is attacked. As such, it’s unlikely that any concrete commitments on this front will emerge from the Vilnius event. But Ukraine is nevertheless looking for verbal guarantees that extend beyond what it sees as the timid and vague assurances offered so far.  Zelenskyy’s office did not immediately respond to NBC News’ requests for comment on whether Zelenskyy would attend.  “It’s been very clear that Ukraine wants some enhanced statement, rather than just a reaffirmation of the open-door policy,” said Neil Melvin, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank. “But I think that the time frame will remain open and tied very much to when the war ends.”  For Ukraine, this is not just about its own safety but also providing a bulwark against Russia trying to invade other countries farther into Europe. Zelenskyy has been adamant since the early days of the war that Ukraine needs to join NATO for any long-term peace agreement to hold not only within Ukraine, but beyond its borders.  His country has been given promises in the past that have not borne fruit. In 2008,  Ukraine and the former Soviet republic of Georgia were both told that they would become members of the alliance. But crucially they were not given what’s known as a “Membership Action Plan,” a formal pathway for any would-be NATO member.  Biden under pressure after providing cluster bombs to Ukraine July 9, 2023 01:50 Membership never happened for either country. And later that year  Russia was at war with Georgia , and  in 2014 made its first incursion into Ukraine and annexed its Crimea Peninsula. So it’s against this backdrop that Zelenskyy appears to be willing to stage something of a grand statement — snubbing his invitation as an honored guest — unless tangible assurances are offered. There were encouraging signs for Kyiv on Monday.  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba  tweeted that NATO had “reached consensus” on removing the Membership Action Plan requirement from Ukraine’s path into the alliance. Kuleba said it “shortens” Ukraine’s path to NATO and is the “best moment” to offer clarity on a membership invitation. There was no immediate comment from NATO.  But NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday that he expects the summit to yield a three-point package to bring Ukraine closer to NATO: a multiyear program of assistance, increased political ties and “reaffirmation that Ukraine will become a member of NATO.” It comes at a key time for Ukraine, which is in the middle of  a counteroffensive to reclaim territory occupied by Russia , itself apparently weakened by  the brief Wagner rebellion last month . But with the counteroffensive going slower than planned, Ukraine is grasping for anything that could help turn the tide, including  cluster munitions , which Washington last week agreed to provide after months of hesitation over the  moral and reputational implications of supplying and using such weapons.  The weapons have been banned in more than 100 countries because they pose a life-threatening danger to civilians long after conflict, and the White House suggested last year that Russia’s use of them in Ukraine was a potential war crime. Meanwhile a poll released Monday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology suggested 89% of Ukrainians want their country to join NATO, a desire that has grown steadily since Crimea was annexed in 2014 and a military conflict broke out in the country’s east. And yet, while war rages, the possibility of full membership for Ukraine looks distant. “I can’t see any prospect for Ukraine joining NATO before” there is “at the very least the liberation of all occupied territories,” said Mark Galeotti, who heads the Russia-focused consultancy Mayak Intelligence. “No one wants, in effect, to commit NATO to war with Moscow.” Nevertheless it’s an idea that, in theory at least, does have support among some Western allies. And to firm up that support this week, Zelenskyy went on a diplomatic offensive, touring several NATO member capitals. Turkey, NATO’s largest army after the U.S., and Czechia are among the countries that have recently said they back Ukraine’s accession as soon as conditions allow.  Ukraine knows it can’t change NATO’s mind at such short notice, according to Volodymyr Fesenko, a Ukrainian political analyst, but Zelenskyy wants to show Biden that he has “sufficiently massive support of Ukraine’s NATO membership among” its member countries, Fesenko wrote in an analysis posted on Facebook. Appearing in person would be crucial to that, Fesenko said. Other experts also said that it is in the Ukrainian president’s interests to show his face at the summit in Vilnius rather than stage a high-profile boycott. Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, a former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, says he is “sure that President Zelenskyy will appear in Vilnius” so he can have some influence over the talks. “He can see and sense the growing support for Ukrainian membership” and “he knows that this is a long process, yet his support across NATO is growing,” said Hodges, who supports the country joining the alliance.  “He will be there in Vilnius to demonstrate his determination, his calm, poised leadership and to remind everyone of the courage and sacrifice of Ukraine, from which all of Europe is benefiting,” he said."

      "Text": "Biden to meet with Zelensky during NATO summit By  Arlette Saenz , CNN Updated9:25 PM EDT, Mon July 10, 2023 Link Copied! Ad Feedback U.S. President Joe Biden meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during the G7 Summit at the Grand Prince Hotel in Hiroshima, Japan, May 21, 2023. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Vilnius, Lithuania CNN President Joe Biden will meet with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the NATO summit on Wednesday, an official familiar with the meeting has confirmed. The meeting will mark a sign of unity as Zelensky’s attendance at the summit had been in question.  Russia’s war in Ukraine is among the top agenda items for NATO leaders along with discussing a future pathway for the war-torn country to join the alliance, which has prompted some division among leaders.  Politico was first to report the meeting. Ukraine is set to dominate the summit’s agenda as the US president looks to keep the group united behind Zelensky in the face of Russia’s invasion. The alliance is facing questions about a potential path to NATO membership for Ukraine, as well as additional military assistance as its counteroffensive continues.  Biden poured cold water on the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO as the war is ongoing and cited reforms the country would still need to make to join the alliance.  “I don’t think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war,” Biden told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria last week.  Zelensky had previously said he does not plan on attending the summit “for fun” as he seeks a clearer pathway for his country to join the alliance along with security guarantees.  “It would be an important message to say that NATO is not afraid of Russia. Ukraine should get clear security guarantees while it is not in NATO. Only under these conditions, our meeting would be meaningful, otherwise it’s just another politics,” Zelensky said in an interview with ABC.  Biden and Zelensky have had multiple high-profile meetings over the last several months. The  Ukrainian president’s first trip outside Ukraine since the war began was to Washington just before Christmas, where he was feted by Biden in the Oval Office before giving a speech to Congress. A couple months later, Biden  made a surprise visit to Kyiv to return the favor and announce a half-billion dollar assistance package. The dramatic scene was marked by air raid sirens going off as the two presidents walked near the gold-domed St. Michael’s Cathedral.  Their last in-person meeting took place  at the G-7 Summit in Hiroshima, Japan, in May . Zelensky used the opportunity to press the world leaders for more assistance, coming just after the Russians took the town of Bakhmut following months of heavy fighting.  During this NATO summit, Biden could face some scolding from allies over his decision to provide cluster munitions to Ukraine for the first time. The move, aimed at bolstering Ukraine’s offensive capabilities, has prompted some public disagreement from allied countries Biden called it a “difficult decision” in his interview with Zakaria but said it was necessary because Ukraine is running low on ammunition. Zelensky said Friday that Ukraine was grateful for a ‘timely, broad and much-needed’ defense aid package from the United States. “A timely, broad and much-needed defense aid package from the United States. We are grateful to the American people and President Joseph Biden for decisive steps that bring Ukraine closer to victory over the enemy, and democracy to victory over dictatorship,” Zelensky said in a message on Twitter.  “The expansion of Ukraine’s defense capabilities will provide new tools for the de-occupation of our land and bringing peace closer,” he said."

More to the point, the alliance is not yet ready for Ukraine to join in a historic step that could deter Moscow but that might also increase the risk of a US-Russia war. Biden has staked his foreign policy legacy on arming Ukraine to repel the Russian invasion – most recently with a contentious decision to send  cluster bombs . But he nevertheless sent a strong message to Kyiv in an  exclusive CNN interview that its increasingly sharp campaign is unlikely to result in a certain date for NATO entry emerging from the alliance’s summit in Lithuania this week.  While some eastern European alliance members are bullish on an early timetable to welcome Ukraine, some first-generation states, including the US, are more cautious, partly due to fears that moving quickly on NATO membership could provoke the direct conflict with Russia that Biden is desperate to avoid. President Joe Biden speaks with CNN's Fareed Zakaria during a televised interview inside the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, on Friday, July 7, 2023.  Tom Brenner for CNN CNN Exclusive: Biden says war with Russia must end before NATO can consider membership for Ukraine “I don’t think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war,” Biden said in an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria broadcast on Sunday. The president said that the alliance needed to lay out a “rational path” for Ukraine’s membership but that it was still short of some requirements for joining, including over democratization. While Biden said he had discussed the issue at length with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and had refused before the war to allow Russian President Vladimir Putin a veto on Kyiv’s eventual membership, his comments will disappoint Ukraine as it suffers through a horrific war that has seen multiple crimes against humanity. Ukraine has often warned it is fighting the West’s war against Russian expansionism and has weakened NATO’s top adversary in Europe, and so therefore has a moral case for the defense guarantees NATO states enjoy. But even Zelensky accepts that Ukraine cannot join NATO while the war rages on.  Still, he hinted in an interview with ABC News aired Sunday that he wouldn’t be a guest at the NATO summit “for fun” and could stay away unless there was more clarity on membership and security guarantees. “It would be an important message to say that NATO is not afraid of Russia,” he said.  A fateful decision  Deciding whether Ukraine joins NATO is one of the most fateful European security questions since waves of expansion took the alliance right up to Russia’s borders in a process advocates say guaranteed post-Cold War peace by deterring Kremlin aggression. Critics of enlargement into formerly Soviet Eastern Europe, however, argue the process humiliated Moscow, turned it back into an avowed foe of the West and helped lead to the invasion of Ukraine. A decision to admit Ukraine would extend the sacred NATO pledge that an attack on one member is an attack on all to a nation Russia regards, at a minimum, as part of its sphere of influence – even if such a claim has no basis in international law. It would commit future Western leaders to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and potentially risk a third World War if the Kremlin attacked its neighbor again.  Reps. Michael McCaul and Barbara Lee Getty Images A top House Republican backs Biden&#x27;s decision to send cluster munitions to Ukraine, while a prominent Democrat disagrees Supporters of Ukraine’s membership in NATO, however, argue that decades of security and territorial integrity provided to ex-Warsaw Pact nations like Poland, Hungary and Romania are in itself proof that once under NATO’s mutual defense umbrella, Ukraine would at last be safe from future incursions by Moscow. The argument is especially resonant since summit host Lithuania, like its fellow Baltic states Latvia and Estonia, was once annexed by the Soviet Union and considered highly vulnerable to Russia before its entry into NATO in 2004. - Source: CNN Video Ad Feedback Why NATO is so significant in the West&#x27;s relationship with Russia 03:50 - Source: CNN The case for Ukraine in NATO Broadly, the case for NATO welcoming Ukraine includes those ironclad security guarantees that would be designed to dispel its vulnerability to Russian attack. Supporters of Kyiv’s accession point out that a vague promise of future membership – first made at its summit in Bucharest in 2008 with no realistic timetable for entry – offered Putin an incentive to invade before Ukraine joined the club.  NATO membership would also boost Ukraine’s bid to cement a democracy that was vulnerable before the war and fulfill the desire of many of its people to join the West. With its brutal war, Moscow has forfeited any moral say in whether Ukraine should join or not. And the addition of Europe’s most battle-hardened army, with more personnel under arms than most member states, would stiffen NATO’s military punch. Sens. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, last week introduced a resolution calling for a roadmap to Ukraine’s NATO membership as soon as it is practicable. “It is only through NATO membership that Ukraine can experience true security in the face of repeated Russian aggression,” the senators said in a statement. “Their fight has been a stand against corrupt crony authoritarianism and they have earned a secure and lasting peace within NATO.” The case against There are short- and long-term arguments against NATO offering membership to Ukraine. Biden warned in his CNN interview that to do so in a time of war would immediately commit the alliance to defend a new partner – to prove the group’s collective defense is meaningful. “I mean what I say,” the president said. “It’s a commitment that we’ve all made no matter what. If the war is going on, then we’re all in war. We’re at war with Russia, if that were the case.”  Offering Ukraine a set date to join after the war ends might be counterproductive since it would give the Kremlin a rationale for never ending the conflict. This would dash admittedly thin hopes for a political settlement if Ukraine’s forces are ultimately unable to expel all Russian forces. And it would risk strengthening Putin at home by appearing to justify one of his rationales for the unprovoked invasion – his baseless allegation that the West triggered the war to claim Ukraine in a bid to weaken Russian power. Libkos/AP Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine As he headed to the United Kingdom on the first leg of his European visit, Biden got an endorsement of his strategy from GOP Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who said it was “way too premature” to talk about Ukraine immediately joining NATO. “First they have to win the counteroffensive, secondly, have a cease-fire, and then negotiate a peace settlement. We cannot admit Ukraine into NATO immediately. That would put us at war with Russia,” the Texas Republican said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.  “So I think what the conversation is going to be about is, what security agreements can be put in place with Ukraine as a predicate to perhaps ascension of Ukraine into NATO?” he said, adding, “We have to be careful in the way we do this.” US and European security guarantees to Ukraine – beyond the multi-billion dollar effort to arm the country to fend off Russia’s threat – would change the strategic picture in Western Europe. They would also be made with no guarantee that the Kremlin would become more benign toward the West in future decades. But there is no reason, for example, why the US and its allies cannot make a commitment to offer Ukraine the means to defend itself – short of NATO membership – much as the US does with Israel and Taiwan. The risk of a clash with Russia in the future weighs heavily on the minds of many analysts. “The United States should not guarantee Ukrainian security. Period,” said Ben Friedman, policy director at Defense Priorities, a think tank dedicated to promoting a realist vision of national security policy. “We shouldn’t do so now, via NATO or otherwise (through) some sort of bilateral security guarantees, and we shouldn’t do so as part of a peace deal.”  Friedman argued that despite Ukraine’s heroic resistance, wider considerations of Washington’s interests must take priority. “Guaranteeing Ukraine’s security would erode US security by increasingly the risk, obviously, of war with Russia,” he said. “That contains the risk, of course, of nuclear escalation, and for that risk I think the United States receives basically nothing of security value.” Neither Biden, nor any other member of his administration have made a case to the American people as to why ultimately it would be in the interest of 330 million Americans to go to war with Moscow to defend Ukraine if it joined NATO. In fact, the president has made an opposite, implicit case, stressing that despite a proxy-war type situation in Ukraine, his core concern is avoiding a direct clash with Russia. Advocates of NATO welcoming Ukraine often argue that no such undertaking was secured from American voters regarding other formally communist Eastern European states once in the Soviet Union’s orbit. But Ukraine could be more at risk since it carries greater cultural and historical associations – and, for Russia, it is linked to its self-identity, whether justified or not. One potential downfall of offering Ukraine eventual security guarantees through NATO or another mechanism would be if political will to enforce them ebbs in future. A failure to defend such guarantees would raise grave doubts about NATO’s existing mutual defense ethos and could end up disastrously weakening the integrity of the alliance.  Even if Biden were to amend his position on accelerating NATO membership for Ukraine, he cannot ensure a successor would honor treaty obligations. Indeed, ex-President Donald Trump has been loudly warning that Biden is leading the US into a potential World War III against Russia, and he has insisted he’d end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours if elected to a new term. Such comments suggest more sympathy to the goals of Putin, to whom he has often cozied up.  The uncertain political situation in the US may be one reason why Zelensky has appeared so desperate to ensure his country’s urgent NATO aspirations are set in stone at this week’s summit."

Biegun July 8, 2023 at 6:30 a.m. EDT Skip to main content To stop Putin To strengthen Zelensky To save American taxpayers billions of dollars To normalize relations with Russia To strengthen NATO Listen 11 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share Marc A. Thiessen is a Post contributing columnist. Stephen E. Biegun was deputy secretary of state from 2019 to 2021. At his final NATO summit, in Bucharest, Romania, in 2008, President George W. Bush pushed, cajoled and pleaded with allies to invite Ukraine and Georgia into the alliance. Such a move,  Bush explained , would send “a signal throughout the region that these two nations are, and will remain, sovereign and independent states.” Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Vladimir Putin was at the summit, and he watched as Bush  was rebuffed . “Ukraine is not a country,” the Russian leader  told Bush . Within six years, Russia had invaded both countries. Now, NATO can undo at least a part of its mistake. On Tuesday, leaders will gather in Vilnius, Lithuania, with the situation reversed: The majority of allies  want to set a specific timetable for Kyiv’s admission, and it is the United States  that is resisting , concerned that a specific membership pledge will provoke Russia. It’s the same flawed reasoning that has led the administration  to withhold critical weapons such as the tanks, long-range missiles and advanced fighter jets Ukraine needs to retake its territory. Almost 75 years after NATO’s founding, the record is clear. NATO doesn’t provoke war; it guarantees peace. Advertisement No serious person advocates NATO membership for Ukraine while the current fighting continues. That would be tantamount to a declaration of war with Russia. But it is equally true that after a cease-fire, a durable peace cannot be achieved unless that peace is guaranteed by NATO membership. Follow this author Marc A. Thiessen Follow Here are five reasons we must bring Ukraine into NATO — and a clear plan to do it. To stop Putin Return to menu Putin won’t willingly give up on his quest to conquer Ukraine as long as he believes he can succeed. He will use any cessation of hostilities to pause, reconstitute his forces and resume his invasion in a few years’ time — just like he did in after his 2014 invasion and annexation of Crimea. He made his objectives abundantly clear in a nearly 7,000-word manifesto,  published in 2021 , in which he explained that Ukrainians and Russians are “one people,” descendants of “Ancient Rus” bound together by common language, culture and religion. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he said, “Russia was robbed” and Ukrainians were separated “from their historical motherland.” He will not stop until he incorporates Ukraine into a restored Russian Empire. Advertisement In pursuing this goal, Putin is playing a long game. He assumes Western interest in helping Ukraine will wane over time as costs escalate and new crises inevitably arise elsewhere. He doesn’t need to win, in his judgment; he just needs to keep fighting until we quit. The only way to stop him is to make his goals impossible to achieve. And the way to do that is to bring Ukraine into NATO. Critics of NATO membership say it will provoke Putin to keep fighting. Recent history shows otherwise: Putin has invaded only non-NATO countries. To leave Ukraine outside the NATO alliance is an invitation to renewed aggression. NATO membership will cement the reality that Ukraine’s destiny belongs in the West, in NATO and in the European Union. The sooner Putin is confronted with that clear and unmistakable reality, the sooner he will be forced to accept that he has lost his war. To strengthen Zelensky Return to menu If Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that he was willing to consider a peace deal that left any Ukrainian territory in Russian hands, he’d be thrown out of office. The Ukrainian people are in no mood for compromise. A Gallup poll published in October found that  70 percent favor fighting until victory, which they overwhelmingly define as retaking all territory seized by Russia since 2014, including Crimea. A Democratic Initiatives Foundation poll published in May found those views virtually unchanged:  Sixty-seven percent of Ukrainians  said that no concessions to Russia were acceptable, while just 22 percent supported some compromises to end the war. Advertisement Only by delivering NATO security guarantees can Zelensky sell a cease-fire or armistice to his citizens — especially if Ukraine has not achieved its goals of driving Russia completely out of every inch of Ukraine’s sovereign territory. Right now, Ukraine is in the early stages of its counteroffensive. It needs time and resources to bring that operation to a successful conclusion. The United States should support Ukraine in its effort to recover all of its illegally occupied lands from Russia — and America must not use the promise of NATO membership to pressure Kyiv to make territorial concessions. But a time might come when Zelensky could face a choice similar to that faced by West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in 1955, when his country was physically divided and at grave risk from the Soviet Union. Adenauer had to decide between holding out for full reunification or securing the part of Germany he controlled by anchoring it in the NATO alliance. He chose security — and 34 years later, his choice was vindicated when the Berlin Wall fell and his country was reunited as a free, sovereign and democratic state. Advertisement Zelensky might become strong enough with voters to do the same, former national security adviser Stephen J. Hadley tells us, “if part of the deal is NATO membership — not in six years, not in six months, NATO membership right then. … Because that’s his insurance policy that the Russian invasion is not going to be resumed from that portion of the territory of Ukraine that Russia still occupies.” It will be up to Ukrainians to decide whether to join NATO before they have fully reunified their country. If they do, NATO should not recognize Russian annexation of any Ukrainian territory — just as allies never recognized the Soviet annexation of the Baltic states. But the only way Ukrainians will be able to make that choice is if it is backed by NATO’s Article 5 guarantee that an attack on one is an attack on all. To save American taxpayers billions of dollars Return to menu Peace is cheaper than war. Without NATO membership, Ukraine will be a constant magnet for Russian aggression — and the United States will continue to be drawn into aiding Ukraine’s self-defense. We must foreclose future attacks. Otherwise, Putin will resume his invasion a few years after any cease-fire — at a cost of further tens of billions to American taxpayers. Advertisement Something similar is true when it comes to Ukraine’s postwar reconstruction. The World Bank estimates the cost of rebuilding the war-ravaged country at  $411 billion . Some of that cost can be covered  by tapping the $300 billion in Russian Central Bank assets that Western banks have frozen since last year. Much of the rest can come from private-sector investment — but only if investors have confidence the Russian assault won’t resume. By creating confidence that attracts private investment, NATO membership will also help the Ukrainian economy, allowing Kyiv to provide for its own defense, just as Poland and the Baltic states — already NATO members — do today. A stable, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine will be a customer and trading partner for America. An unstable Ukraine, under constant threat from Russia, will be a continual drain on U.S. resources. To normalize relations with Russia Return to menu As distant as the possibility seems, the West will never build a constructive relationship with Russia until the option of aggression against Ukraine is off the table once and for all. In Bucharest, Bush declared that “the Europe we are building must also be open to Russia”; that “we have a stake in Russia’s success” and “look for the day when Russia is fully reformed, fully democratic and closely bound to the rest of Europe.” He added that “Russia is part of Europe and, therefore, does not need a buffer zone of insecure states separating it from Europe.” Advertisement Russia’s belligerent conduct over the ensuing 15 years makes those words seem fanciful. But Bush was correct: NATO membership for Ukraine would create stability, which in turn might one day turn into cooperation. It could take years, even decades, before Russia is able to accept those opportunities. But it will never come as long as Russia eyes Ukraine as prey to be swallowed — an option that NATO membership would forever foreclose. To strengthen NATO Return to menu Finally, bringing Ukraine into NATO is good not just for Ukraine; it is good for NATO, too. Ukraine now has the most capable, battle-hardened, NATO-interoperable military in Europe. Unlike some allies, it will have no trouble or hesitation meeting its NATO obligation to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense. It will be a net contributor to European security and thus strengthen the alliance. Advertisement So what are the next steps? NATO leaders should approach the Vilnius summit as a two-part process. Part 1, in Vilnius, should be an unambiguous commitment by NATO, led by the United States, to invite Ukraine to join the alliance at the 75th-anniversary summit in Washington next summer. Then, NATO must create the security the alliance will guarantee, by spending the coming year helping Ukraine shape the conflict with Russia to a point where the invitation can safely be extended in 2024. In shaping conditions on the ground, the United States’ objective should be to help Ukraine regain every inch of its territory as soon as possible. It is a mistake to think that a quick and decisive war creates any greater risk of escalation than a long, drawn-out stalemate. That means delivering all the weapons Ukraine is seeking to make its counteroffensive succeed — including long-range precision missiles, tanks and advanced fighter aircraft. Greater progress on the battlefield will bring the war to a point where a cease-fire is Russia’s only option — and Zelensky’s defense of his country is a clear success. Then, Ukraine can pivot to securing its military gains with NATO membership. Some have suggested non-NATO alternatives for Ukraine’s long-term security. For example, they point out that America’s commitment to Israel is clear despite the absence of a mutual defense treaty that requires America to come to Israel’s defense. We would argue that Israel’s real deterrent is the perception by its adversaries that it possesses nuclear weapons. (Israel has never confirmed nor denied a nuclear capability.) Ukraine once had its own nuclear deterrent but relinquished the weapons at the insistence of the United States in the 1990s. Absent restoring that deterrent, the only thing that will prevent Russia from violating Ukraine’s sovereignty again is an Article 5 security guarantee from NATO. Advertisement Others say the United States could declare Ukraine a “ Major Non-NATO Ally .” This would be nothing more than a symbolic gesture. MNNA status gives a designated country priority access to U.S. military equipment — something Ukraine already has in abundance — but does not entail any security commitments. It would amount to an empty promise, and Putin would conclude that the United States has blinked again. If progress in retaking territory comes more slowly, and Ukrainian leaders feel confident they can continue to achieve their goals on the battlefield, NATO should support that decision. The alliance can issue a formal invitation to membership at the Washington summit but wait to ratify Ukraine’s accession until its leaders are ready to choose this course. Ultimately, it must be up to Ukraine when to disengage militarily and join NATO. Right now, President Biden appears to have no theory for victory, much less a theory for peace. He needs to appreciate that he has nailed America’s colors to the mast in Ukraine. We might not have soldiers fighting in this war, but make no mistake: This is our war. If the fight in Ukraine is lost, it will be America’s defeat; if it is won, it will be America’s victory — and, by extension, Biden’s victory. It is baffling that Biden does not see a specific pledge of NATO membership for Ukraine as the key to unlock a historic success. The only way he can end this conflict, and bring stability to Ukraine and the rest of Europe, is for NATO to draw a bright line that Russia dare not cross."

President Biden said during an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria that aired Sunday that he doesn’t believe there will be “unanimity” on the issue of Ukraine’s membership while the nation remains “in the middle of a war.” Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight “We’re determined to [protect] every inch of territory that is NATO territory,” Biden said, noting that if Ukraine were part of NATO, it would put the alliance at war with Russia. Biden added that it was “premature” to call for a vote on Ukrainian membership because the country still has to meet some NATO qualifications. Biden said he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have spoken at length about the issue of membership, and said the two have to lay out a “rational path ... for Ukraine to be able to qualify.” Biden heads to NATO summit facing fresh divisions over Ukraine Still, Biden said the United States remains committed to supplying the war-torn nation with the security assistance it needs to continue fending off Russia. Advertisement Like Biden, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said talk of Ukraine’s membership is “too premature.” McCaul told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday that Ukraine has to win the counteroffensive against Russia, secure a cease-fire and negotiate a peace settlement before joining NATO. “We cannot admit Ukraine into NATO immediately; that would put us at war with Russia under  Article 5 of the United Nations ,” McCaul said. Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) told CBS News’s “Face the Nation” that the war “has to end with Ukrainian victory,” and that Ukraine also has to join the European Union, which involves “improving their transparency, their rule of law, their civil society, which lays the foundation for NATO membership in the future.” Ukraine clamps down on corruption as Western supporters cast watchful eye The comments on Ukraine’s bid for NATO membership come days after Biden  approved sending U.S. cluster munitions to Ukraine. The weapons have been controversial because they explode in the air over a target, releasing dozens to hundreds of smaller submunitions across a wide area. More than 120 countries have  joined a convention banning their use as inhumane and indiscriminate, in part because unexploded submunitions litter the landscape and endanger both troops and civilians. National security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday that Ukraine has agreed to not use these powerful munitions on Russian territory. It will only use such weapons in its own territory, where, he said, Kyiv has “the highest incentive to limit the impact to civilians, because it is Ukrainian citizens who would be at risk.” Ukraine also agreed not to use the munitions in populated areas, Sullivan said. Advertisement Zelensky, in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC, said  inviting Ukraine into NATO is “all a matter of political will.” In the meantime, Zelensky said Ukraine “should get clear security guarantees” from NATO members in the effort against Russia. “It would be an important message to say that NATO is not afraid of Russia,” he said. Zelensky said he will attend the summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, this week, to do whatever he can to “expedite that solution to have an agreement with our partners.” “I don’t want to go to Vilnius for fun,” he said. Ukraine wants and expects an invitation to join NATO. Allies are not sure. John Kirby, the spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, said on ABC’s “This Week” that strong commitments will be made to Ukraine during the upcoming summit. “You’re going to see the allies really stay unified on supporting Ukraine in this fight against Russia on their soil,” Kirby said. “You’re also going to see from all the allies a concerted, unified approach to making it clear that NATO is eventually going to be in Ukraine’s future, and that in between the time of the war ending and that happening, that the allies will continue to help Ukraine defend itself.” Advertisement While Biden remained skeptical of Ukraine’s ascension into the alliance in the immediate future, he told CNN he is optimistic that Sweden, which has also been fighting for membership, will become a NATO member soon. Extending membership to a new nation requires the approval of all NATO allies, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have  cited  objections to adding Sweden. “Sweden has the same value set that we have in NATO, [is] a small nation, but has a capacity to defend itself, as they know how to fight,” Biden said, echoing other statements he has made in the lead-up to the summit. “I think they should be a member of NATO.” Outliers Turkey, Hungary threaten NATO unity in standoff with Russia Turkey has criticized Sweden for refusing to extradite individuals it sees as terrorists, including members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and a movement accused of trying to overthrow the Turkish government in 2016. Turkey also has complained about anti-Erdogan protests held in Sweden and demonstrations at which Qurans were burned. Advertisement Officials in Hungary, meanwhile, have cited a variety of reasons for their country’s refusal to ratify Sweden’s accession, from what a government spokesman said was Stockholm’s eagerness to “bash Hungary” to the Nordic country’s “crumbling throne of moral superiority.” Biden, in the interview with CNN, responded to Turkey’s criticisms by arguing that it isn’t “Swedes that are burning the Quran. They are immigrants who are burning the Quran.” The White House said Biden and Erdogan spoke Sunday about Sweden’s membership bid and Biden “conveyed his desire to welcome Sweden into NATO as soon as possible.” Erdogan told Biden that Sweden has taken the “correct steps” to appease Turkey’s concerns by passing anti-terrorism policies — but that these policies were voided by PKK protests, per Turkey’s  state news agency"

Biden told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria that members lack the required “unanimity” as to whether to allow Ukraine to join. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight NATO member states will meet in Vilnius, Lithuania, this week, with Ukraine’s candidacy and Sweden’s blocked bid to join the military alliance expected to dominate the agenda. Biden heads to Europe on Monday, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told ABC’s “This Week” that he plans to be in Vilnius. Here’s the latest on the war and its ripple effects around the globe. Upcoming NATO summit Biden said he wants to lay out a “rational path” for Ukraine to join NATO.  He cited increased democratization as a bar Ukraine probably would need to meet, in addition to issues the ongoing war presents. He reiterated his commitment to protecting “every inch of territory that is NATO territory,” which would practically put members “at war with Russia” if Ukraine were to join. Biden faces the challenge of uniting allies at this week’s NATO summit, where divisions are mounting over the Ukraine war. In addition to questions over the  expansion of the alliance , Ukraine’s demand for an invitation and Turkey’s resistance to Sweden’s membership bid, Biden is also likely to face tensions over the U.S. decision to  supply cluster munitions to Ukraine — which has also  been criticized by figures within his own party Zelensky plans to go to the summit and try to “expedite” Ukraine’s desired accession to NATO , he told ABC News in an interview that aired Sunday. And Ukraine “should get clear security guarantees” even while it is not part of the defense alliance, he said. Biden and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed Turkey’s resistance to Sweden joining NATO in a Sunday phone call, the Turkish state media Anadolu Agency  reported . Turkey opposes Sweden’s bid because of its view that the Nordic nation has a soft touch with protesters who have burnt Qurans,  among other issues . Biden, who supports Sweden’s accession, and Erdogan also discussed Turkey’s efforts to join the European Union and  agreed to meet one-on-one during this week’s summit. Other key developments The leaders of Britain, Germany and Spain said they would not send cluster munitions to Ukraine , distancing themselves from the U.S. decision. Canada also opposes the move, an official told The Washington Post, citing an  international treaty prohibiting their use and transfer. The United States, Ukraine and Russia are  not signatories to the treaty. Some Democratic lawmakers criticized the decision to send cluster munitions to Ukraine. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), who is also running for Senate, said the United States would “risk losing our moral leadership” by facilitating the weapon’s use in Ukraine. “When you look at the fact that over 120 countries have signed the convention on cluster munitions, saying they should never be used, they should never be used,” Lee said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “This is a line that I don’t believe we should cross.” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and former senator Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) also opposed the decision in a  Washington Post opinion article Friday. U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Sunday that the dud rate on U.S.-supplied cluster munitions is low and promised assistance with demining “when war conditions permit.\" Speaking to ABC anchor Martha Raddatz, Kirby argued that Russia has already used cluster munitions in Ukraine, “in an aggressive war on another country, and indiscriminately killing civilians,\" while the Ukrainians “will be using them to defend their own territory.” The Russian embassy in the U.S. called the decision to send cluster munitions to Ukraine a war crime late Sunday in a Telegram  message Moscow accused Kyiv and Ankara of violating a prisoner exchange agreement after five commanders from Ukraine’s Azov Brigade returned to Ukraine from Turkey, where they had been held after being freed from Russian captivity. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency  RIA Novosti that neither Turkey nor Ukraine consulted Russia about the transfer. Zelensky’s office  said he accompanied the men from an Istanbul airport back to Ukraine after a state visit to Turkey. Ukraine hailed Turkey’s facilitation of the release of the Azov Brigade commanders who defended a steel plant in the southern port city of  Mariupol last year during a nearly three-month siege. Peskov, however, said Saturday that the release breached the terms of an agreement. After Russia captured the Azov Brigade commanders in spring 2022, they were transferred to Turkey as part of a prisoner swap. Zelensky  said at the time that they would stay there until the end of the war. The  Azov Brigade is one of Ukraine’s most adept military units. Formerly an independent, far-right militia with ultranationalist roots, it was designated by Russia as a  terrorist group in 2022. Battleground updates Ten people were killed in Russian attacks across the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine Ukraine’s national police said Sunday.  According to a message on Telegram , 13 people were also injured in the strikes, which hit residential buildings, a shop, a youth center and cars. Russia is strengthening defenses on the Crimean Peninsula in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive , Ukraine’s military media center said Saturday on  Telegram . Russian troops are carrying out fortifications in the north, west and east of the peninsula, including provisions to prevent attacks on ships and fleet bases, the statement added. Russia  illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to environmental damage worth $56 billion , the Ukrainian minister for environmental protection said in a  statement . Each day of the war, now in its second year, causes more than $100 million of environmental damage, he said, adding that the estimate did not include the destruction caused by the recent breach of the  Kakhovka dam Russian air defenses on Sunday intercepted missiles over the regions of Rostov and Bryansk, as well as Crimea, Russian officials in the three areas said on Telegram. The Post could not independently verify the claims and Ukraine did not publicly address the incidents. Russian officials didn’t report any casualties from the missiles or the falling debris. Global developments Polish President Andrzej Duda made an unannounced visit to the western Ukrainian city of Lutsk on Sunday where alongside Zelensky he commemorated the 80th anniversary of anti-Polish massacres,  according to his office . The Volhynia massacres — in which  Warsaw estimates 100,000 Poles were killed by Ukrainian nationalists — have strained ties between the countries since World War II. Sunday’s joint service underlines how Russia’s invasion has pushed neighboring countries to directly address old wounds, bringing them closer. Poland has  been a major hub for the delivery of aid to Ukraine during the war. Portugal supports Ukraine’s NATO candidacy , the two countries said in a  statement Saturday, after a phone call between their leaders. Portugal has provided substantial military aid to Ukraine independently and through the European Union initiative.  In March , Portugal delivered three Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine. From our correspondents Ukraine pushes to reclaim Bakhmut, fighting on fallen city’s flanks: Russia captured the embattled city of Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, in May following weeks of fierce fighting — its only significant territorial gain in 2023. But now, its troops are battling Ukraine’s counteroffensive push from the city’s flanks in an inch-by-inch fight, report Fredrick Kunkle and Serhii Korolchuk. On a recent moonlit night, a four-man Ukrainian squad attempted to float a drone amid the ruins of a kindergarten in a village south of the city. “We are trying to pin as many Muscovites as possible around Bakhmut,” said Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow with Ukraine’s National Institute for Strategic Studies."

The Kremlin, meanwhile, pursued its relentless bombardment of Kyiv with a third assault on the city  in 24 hours The Russian Defense Ministry said five drones were shot down in Moscow and the systems of three others were jammed, causing them to veer off course. It called the incident a “terrorist attack” by the “Kyiv regime.” READ MORE: Russia issues arrest warrant for Lindsey Graham over comments on war in Ukraine The attack, causing only what Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin called “insignificant damage” to several buildings, brought the war home to civilians in Russia’s capital. Two people received treatment for unspecified injuries but did not need hospitalization, he said in a Telegram post, adding that residents of two high-rise buildings damaged in the attack were evacuated. Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the wider Moscow region, said some of the drones were “shot down on the approach to Moscow.” Ukraine made no direct comment on the attack, which would be one of its deepest and most daring strikes into Russia since the Kremlin launched its  full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than 15 months ago. Russian President Vladimir Putin started work early on Tuesday to receive information about the drone attack from various government agencies, but did not plan to address the nation in the wake of the assault, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Asked by The Associated Press whether there is concern in the Kremlin that the invasion of Ukraine is endangering Russian civilians, Peskov said only that attacks on Russia reinforce the need to prosecute the war. READ MORE: Russia bombards Kyiv during the day after nighttime barrage Russian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said the Kremlin’s policy is to play down the attacks. “You ask, why is Putin behaving like this, does he really not understand and fear the consequences?” she wrote in a Telegram post. “Apparently he isn’t afraid, and everything is built on the idea that has been voiced more than once about a patient people who will understand everything and endure everything.” Still, the attacks raised questions about the effectiveness of Russia’s air defense systems. A senior Russian lawmaker, Andrei Kartapolov, told Russian business news site RBC that “we have a very big country and there will always be a loophole where the drone can fly around the areas where air defense systems are located.” Kartapolov said the purpose of the attacks was to unnerve the Russian people. “It’s an intimidation act aimed at the civilian population,” RBC quoted him as saying. “It’s designed to create a wave of panic.” Moscow residents reported hearing explosions before dawn. Police were seen working at one site of a crashed drone in southwest Moscow. An area near a residential building was fenced off, and police put the drone debris in a cardboard box before carrying it away. At another site, apartment windows were shattered and there were scorch marks on the building’s front. It was the second reported attack on Moscow. Russian authorities said two drones targeted the Kremlin on May 3 in what they portrayed as an attempt on Putin’s life. Ukraine denied it was behind that attack. WATCH: A look at the man running mercenary Wagner Group in Russia’s war against Ukraine Last week, the Russian border region of Belgorod was the target of one of the most serious cross-border raids since the war began, with two far-right pro-Ukrainian paramilitary groups claiming responsibility. Officials in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar near annexed Crimea said two drones struck there on Friday, damaging residential buildings. Other drones have reportedly flown deep into Russia multiple times. In December,  Russia claimed it had shot down drones at airfields in the Saratov and Ryazan regions in western Russia. Three soldiers were reported killed in the attack in Saratov, which targeted an important military airfield. Before that, Russia reported downing a drone that targeted the headquarters of its Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port of Sevastopol. In Ukraine, Russia launched a pre-dawn air raid on Kyiv, killing at least one person and sending the capital’s residents again scrambling into shelters. Ukrainian military analysts, though unable to confirm that Kyiv had launched the drones against Moscow, said the attack may have involved UJ-22 drones with a maximum range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) and are produced in Ukraine. Analyst Oleh Zhdanov said some UJ-22s are capable of reaching “Moscow and beyond,” although he noted they can fly only half as far and carry half the payload of the Iranian-made Shahed drones used in the war by Russia. Even so, Zhdanov told AP that “the myth has been dispelled” of the Russian capital’s invulnerability. READ MORE: Russia says its border regions attacked by artillery fire; Moscow’s forces hit clinic in Ukrainian city Since February, when a UJ-22 crashed 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Moscow, Ukrainian drones repeatedly have repeatedly approached the Russian capital. At least 20 Shahed drones were destroyed by air defense forces in Kyiv’s airspace in Russia’s latest attack on the Ukrainian capital. Overall, Ukraine shot down 29 of 31 drones, most of them in the Kyiv area, the air force said. Before daylight, the buzzing of drones could be heard over the city, followed by loud explosions as they were taken down by air defense systems. The heavier destruction in Kyiv contrasted with what was seen in Moscow in the aftermath of the strikes. In the Ukrainian capital, burned-out cars, glass and debris littered the street outside a building where apartments were wrecked; in Moscow, only a few broken windows and scorched outer walls were evident, with repairs and repainting being done quickly to the affected buildings. A woman who was killed in Kyiv’s Holosiiv district died after she had “come out onto her balcony to look at drones being shot down,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a Telegram post. A high-rise building in the same district caught fire after being hit by debris either from from drones being hit or interceptor missiles. The building’s upper two floors were destroyed, and people were feared to be under the rubble, the Kyiv Military Administration said. More than 20 people were evacuated. Resident Valeriya Oreshko told AP that even though the immediate threat was over, the attacks had everyone on edge. “You are happy that you are alive, but think about what will happen next,” the 39-year-old said. A resident who gave only her first name, Oksana, said the whole building shook when it was hit. “Go to shelters, because you really do not know where (the drone) will fly,” she advised others."

Oksana, who only gave her first name, said the whole building shook when it was hit.  \"Go to shelters, because you really do not know where it (the drone) will fly,\" she advised others. \"We hold on.\"  Elsewhere in the capital, falling debris caused a fire in a private house in the Darnytskyi district and three cars were set alight in the Pechersky district, according to the military administration. A local resident calls with a mobile phone among damaged cars at a multi-story residential building partially destroyed in night drone attacks on Kyiv on May 30, 2023. SERGEI SUPINSKY / AFP via Getty Images The series of attacks that began Sunday included a rare daylight attack Monday that left puffs of white smoke in the blue skies.  On that day, Russian forces fired 11 ballistic and cruise missiles at Kyiv at about 11:30 a.m., according to Ukraine's chief of staff, Valerii Zaluzhnyi. All of them were shot down, he said.  Debris from the intercepted missiles fell in Kyiv's central and northern districts during the morning, landing in the middle of traffic on a city road and also starting a fire on the roof of a building, the Kyiv military administration said. At least one civilian was reported hurt. The Russian Defense Ministry said it launched a series of strikes early Monday targeting Ukrainian air bases with precision long-range air-launched missiles. The strikes destroyed command posts, radars, aircraft and ammunition stockpiles, it claimed. It didn't say anything about hitting cities or other civilian areas."

      "Text": "Ukraine dam: Satellite images reveal Kakhovka canals drying up Published 22 June Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image source,  Reuters By Erwan Rivault, Mark Poynting &amp; Rob England BBC Verify One of Europe&#x27;s largest reservoirs is drying up after the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in southern Ukraine. Satellite images, analysed by BBC Verify, show four canal networks have become disconnected from the reservoir. The UN says drinking water supplies  could be affected for more than 700,000 people , mostly in Russian-occupied areas. Experts say the loss of water from the canals would be critical for food production in the region. The Kakhovka Dam was destroyed in the early hours of 6 June,  causing widespread flooding which hit settlements and farmland across the region.  Your device may not support this visualisation Since the dam collapsed, satellite images show water levels in both the reservoir and the canals it feeds have continued to drop. As well as the canals being a source of drinking water to large parts of southern Ukraine, they also provided irrigation for vast areas of farmland. The dam acted as a flood defence to places downstream, mainly to the south and south-west. BBC Verify monitored the four canal entrances using satellite imagery, and by 15 June, all had become disconnected as the reservoir water level kept dropping. Further images reveal the reservoir, which previously held 18 cubic kilometres of water, had dried up significantly. Shallower parts of the reservoir were exposed first, revealing some of the original shape of the Dnipro River prior to the dam&#x27;s construction in 1956. Images show the canals still contain water further away from the reservoir. It is unclear how long it will take for them to run dry. Before the war, about 5,840 sq km (2,255 sq miles) of cropland on both sides of the Dnipro river could potentially be serviced by the canals, with more than half the area reliant on irrigation systems.  Your device may not support this visualisation These areas yielded about two million tonnes of grain and oil seeds in 2021, according to the Ukrainian government. Many areas downstream of the reservoir were initially flooded after the dam was destroyed, but the long-term issue facing food production will be the loss of water supply due to extensive canal systems drying up, according to Inbal Becker-Reshef, program director at NASA Harvest, a consortium researching global food security. Breaching the Kakhovka dam – who benefits? What we know about Ukraine dam incident Maps and images show scale of Ukraine dam floods While some crops can be fed by rain alone, a dry canal system can leave farmland vulnerable to drought. This also has consequences for drinking water. Dr Becker-Reshef said canals can start to fill in with silt if left dry, reducing their effectiveness, and the longer they are left in this condition, the worse they will become. Ukraine is a major exporter of sunflower, maize, wheat and barley. The war has caused global supply issues, particularly threatened in Middle Eastern and African countries,  which rely heavily on Ukrainian grain Is there a solution? Rebuilding the dam seems to be one of the only long-term solutions to restore water security to the area. Experts warn the area is at greater risk of both drought and flooding, because the dam helped regulate extreme highs and lows in water levels. Unless the dam is repaired, or extensive flood defences put in place, Mr Flikweert said some areas may prove unsuitable for settlement because they lie so close to river level."

      "Text": "Kakhovka collapse: image emerges of apparently explosive-laden car at dam Photograph taken by Ukrainian drone on 28 May said to offer further evidence Russia was behind breach Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates Daniel Boffey in Kyiv Mon 19 Jun 2023 05.58 EDT Last modified on Mon 19 Jun 2023 09.14 EDT A photograph of a car apparently laden with explosives parked at the top of Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam shortly before  it gave way is said to offer further evidence Russia was behind the incident. The image, taken by a Ukrainian drone and given to Associated Press, was taken on 28 May. It appears to show a white car with its roof cut open, revealing large barrels inside, one of which appears to have a landmine attached to its lid. A cable runs from the barrel towards the side of the river held by Russian forces. Russia-Ukraine war live: Moscow blocking aid to flood-hit areas after dam destroyed, says UN Read more A Ukrainian special forces communications official told the Associated Press he believed the car was there to stop any Ukrainian advance on the dam and to amplify a planned explosion originating in the machine room. More than 11,000 people have been evacuated since the dam collapsed on 6 June, flooding land downstream. On Monday the death toll was raised to 52. Russian officials said 35 people had died in the areas of Kherson that were under its control while Ukraine’s interior ministry said they were aware of 17 deaths and 31 people who had gone missing. The warring countries have traded accusations as to who was responsible for the environmental and human disaster. Ukrainian officials claimed to the Associated Press that Russian troops had set up a firing position in the dam shortly before the blast. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has long claimed that the dam was mined by Russia. Vladimir Putin told military bloggers in a recent meeting he had no interest in damaging the dam, which flooded territory controlled by Russia. He did concede that Ukraine’s offensive plans may have been impacted by the flooding of the Dnipro River, which Ukrainian forces need to cross to access the parts of Kherson controlled by Moscow. The image of the white car parked at the top of the dam is just the latest piece in the puzzle, with experts counselling that an authoritative assessment cannot be made until independent engineers are given access. Last week the international human rights law firm  Global Rights Compliance , acting in support of Ukraine’s general prosecutor, said it believed it was “highly likely Russian forces deliberately destroyed the dam”, and that a recently passed Russian law that prohibits investigations into incidents at hydrotechnical structures in Russian-occupied Ukraine offered compelling albeit circumstantial evidence for that case. Seismic signals from an explosion at the dam were picked up on sensors at 2.35am and 2.54am on 6 June. The size of the explosion is said to discount an external attack as being the cause. The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank that has monitored Russian actions in Ukraine since the war began, has claimed that “the balance of evidence, reasoning, and rhetoric suggests that the Russians deliberately damaged the dam”. Ukraine’s intelligence service released an intercepted conversation it claimed was between a Russian soldier and someone else in which the soldier said “our sabotage groups were there. They wanted to create a scare with the dam. It didn’t quite go according to plan.”"

      "Text": "Ukraine dam: What we know about Nova Kakhovka incident Published 8 June Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image source,  Reuters A huge dam in the Russian-controlled area of southern Ukraine has been destroyed, unleashing a flood. Ukraine&#x27;s military and Nato have accused Russia of blowing up the dam, while Russia has blamed Ukraine.  Thousands of people have been evacuated from low-lying areas either side of the river Dnipro. UN humanitarian aid chief Martin Griffiths has warned of grave and far-reaching consequences. Here&#x27;s what we know so far. Where is the dam? The Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant is in the city of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region. The city is currently under Russian occupation.  The dam was built in the Soviet era and is one of six that sit along the Dnipro river, which stretches from the very north of the country into the Black Sea. In Kherson region, Russia occupies the left, or southern, bank while Ukraine controls the right, or northern, bank. The dam holds back a huge reservoir, which locals call the Kakhovka Sea as you cannot see the other bank in certain places.  What happened? Video footage showed a massive breach in the dam, with water surging through it and flooding downstream in the direction of Kherson.  Ukrainian dam operator UkrHydroEnerho said the Nova Kakhovka station was &quot;fully destroyed&quot; and could not be restored. It&#x27;s unclear when exactly the dam was first damaged, but satellite images suggest its condition deteriorated over a number of days.  As water from the vast Kakhovka reservoir poured through the damaged dam, agricultural land and dozens of villages and towns were quickly flooded. Thousands of people from both sides of the river have been evacuated from their homes, but the full scale of the disaster is not yet clear.  Satellite images reveal scale of dam tragedy There are also major environmental concerns. The river has been contaminated with 150 tonnes of industrial lubricant, said President Volodymyr Zelensky, and another 300 tonnes was at risk of leaking. Agricultural land has been washed away and the consequences of the flooding on local farmland is likely to be felt for years. Landmines are also being dislodged by the floodwaters, prompting concerns not just for residents in Kherson, but also those coming to provide assistance.  President Zelensky visited the flood-hit region on Thursday and said the priority was to &quot;protect lives and help people as much as possible&quot;.  He also visited a crossing point in the city where people were being evacuated from the flooded area and a medical facility.  Has the dam been attacked? It&#x27;s not yet clear what caused the breach in the dam, but Ukraine&#x27;s military has accused Russia of deliberately blowing it up. Moscow may have feared that Ukrainian forces would use the road over the dam to get troops across the river into Russian-held territory, as part of a counter-offensive. Mykola Kalinin, chief engineer at a hydropower and water management engineering company in Ukraine, Ukrhydroproject, claimed that an explosion was the cause.  The dam, he told Ukrainian data journalism site Texty, was &quot;built to withstand a super-powerful impact from the outside&quot;. Mr Kalinin concludes that it was mined from the inside. But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov blamed Ukraine, calling it an act of &quot;sabotage&quot; that would deprive the Crimean peninsula - an area annexed by Russia in 2014 -of water.  Neither Ukraine nor Russia&#x27;s claims have been verified by the BBC.  Alternative theories of what could have caused, or at least contributed, to the breaching of the dam have been put forward. Fighting in the area could have affected the structure, Mark Mulligan, professor of Physical Geography at University College London, told the BBC. A second theory he put forward was that Russia, which controls the dam, deliberately allowed water levels to rise in the reservoir behind it - making a collapse more likely and more impactful. According to analysis of satellite imagery carried out by the  US Foreign Agricultural Service , water levels rose sharply over the last few months. However, the dam&#x27;s destruction is hard to assess on satellite imagery alone, as much of the damage is underwater. Mr Zelensky has accused the international community of not reacting fast enough to the flooding, and said without drinking water, food or medicine it was impossible to know how many people would die.  He has accused international organisations, like the Red Cross, of losing the ability to save lives. The World Bank has offered to conduct a rapid assessment of the damage and Ukraine&#x27;s most urgent needs. What was the purpose of the dam? It held back a vast reservoir that supplied water to communities upstream, and provided cooling water to the nuclear power station at Zaporizhzhia, around 160km (100 miles) away, which is under Russian control. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said there was no immediate nuclear safety risk but it was monitoring the situation. It later said that if the dam did fall below 12.7m, the lowest level at which water can still be pumped upstream to Zaporizhzhia, there were alternative water sources to keep the nuclear plant cool. The dam was also a vital channel carrying water from the river to Russian-occupied Crimea, meaning water supplies there are likely to be affected. After Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Ukraine blocked a channel carrying water from Nova Kakhovka, triggering a water crisis on the peninsula. Russian forces reopened the channel after last year&#x27;s invasion. But without the dam, dropping water levels could once again jeopardise the flow of water along the channel. Russia has previously carried out several attacks on dams throughout Ukraine since the invasion, causing widespread flooding and disrupting power supplies."

      "Text": "Will Russia target nuclear plants? For Ukrainians, it feels like a ‘when’, not an if Jade McGlynn Putin has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to do the unthinkable. This time, western allies must be prepared Tue 11 Jul 2023 09.19 EDT Last modified on Tue 11 Jul 2023 12.12 EDT ver since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, western  commentators , policy  advisers , and  political leaders have raised the spectre of nuclear war to argue against supplying Ukrainians with weapons of self-defence for fear of provoking Russia. But this cautious approach could backfire, leading us closer to nuclear catastrophe. For Ukrainians, the question of whether Russia will sabotage the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), Europe’s largest, located in southern Ukraine, has long been a “when”, not an “if”. Last week, Ukrainian civilians and officials shared panicked messages on social media as fears of a potential attack crystallised. Russian embassies and  Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson appeared to be preparing disinformation lines, suggesting that Ukraine, which suffered so terribly from the Chornobyl nuclear accident, could deliberately unleash radioactive terror on its own people. While unconvincing, the rhetoric was an eerie and foreboding reminder of past Kremlin disinformation campaigns following Russian atrocities: the  Skripal poisonings , the  Bucha massacre , the  downing of passenger jet MH17 , and the destruction of the  Kakhovka dam The instinct by some of Ukraine’s allies to reduce the risk of Russia turning to its nuclear arsenal is entirely correct, but the tactics are misguided. The west’s mixed signals over its willingness to defend Ukraine are  widely considered to have contributed to Putin’s decision to launch his genocidal war. Since the invasion 17 months ago, Putin appears to have remained convinced that he has the “strategic patience” to  outlast the west and assure his victory. In his defence, he can cite some compelling evidence to support his belief. After Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the US and EU response  was underwhelming – limited to symbolic but often ineffective personal sanctions. More recently, the international community’s  muted reaction to the  Kakhovka dam catastrophe will have hardly caused him to reconsider his strategy. But in the absence of a  clear, coordinated plan to deal with Russia’s escalating nuclear threats, western leaders have edged us closer to the nuclear disaster they are seeking to avoid. Russia possesses the world’s largest nuclear arsenal, a dubious achievement it is not shy of  broadcasting . A nuclear war would herald the end of global civilisation. Even use of a  tactical nuclear weapon , resulting in a smaller explosion, would be a catastrophe for Ukraine. Any serious assessment of nuclear risk means not underestimating this. But it is also crucial that western leaders consider the consequences of being cowed by Putin’s threats, which are designed to force the world to indulge his rapacious appetite to destroy  Ukraine . By providing Ukraine with war-winning military support, the west can send a message to the Kremlin – and any other irredentist powers – that using nuclear threats will not work. Focusing on Russia’s nuclear arsenal alone distracts from more immediate threats, namely the alleged  positioning of explosives around ZNPP, which has been under occupation by Russian armed forces since March 2022. Russia has amassed military personnel and equipment inside the facility, and there are reports that the children and families of Ukrainian operators forced to work at ZNPP are  being held hostage in Russia , having been removed from the vicinity of the plant under the guise of “evacuation”. Against the backdrop of ongoing Russian war crimes in Ukraine, the fear that the Kremlin is preparing an act of nuclear terrorism is far from unreasonable. When this could occur or what this act might look like remains unclear. Some experts suggest that it is likely Russia will blow up a small part of the plant, such as a cooled reactor, to display what it is capable of, or to slow down the Ukrainian counteroffensive. This would be unlikely to lead to  radiation leakage – but there are also much riskier scenarios. A  stronger explosion could cause damage to the protective shell of a reactor, spreading radiation approximately 350 miles from the site of the blast and creating a disaster of catastrophic scale. Perhaps the threats can be dismissed as part of Russia’s information warfare – another way to terrorise the Ukrainian civilian population. Last week,  10 Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian missiles in Lviv, Ukraine’s most western and peaceful city. But nuclear catastrophe is not something to leave to chance or half measures. The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has worked under trying conditions to ensure the safety of the plant, but it has lost the confidence of many in Ukraine. In its latest inspection, the IAEA insisted the plant was secure but also requested further access, as it was prevented from viewing parts of the site where  Ukrainian officials claim mines have been planted. This situation is untenable. Much more robust action is needed to restore nuclear safety, and confidence. The best possible chance of demilitarising (and de-occupying) ZNPP would involve a multilateral taskforce formed of parties trusted by all sides, including the US, China, India, the UK and the EU, which could supervise the area around the station with IAEA support and expertise. In the absence of such efforts, much of Europe remains hostage to fortune. World leaders must now face up to some tough decisions, rather than giving in once more to Russian blackmail or ignoring the problem until it starts to radiate into Ukraine’s atmosphere – and beyond.

By Nadine El-Bawab July 8, 2023, 6:06 AM 2:30 Residents pass along a street in Nikopol, with the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the background, behind an expanse of sand exposed after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam, in Ukraine, on July 3, 2023. The New York Times via Redux Ukrainian officials have been issuing warnings that Russia plans to blow up the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant -- the largest nuclear plant in Europe -- for months, but those warnings have escalated in recent days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has even warned that Russia has placed objects that could be explosives on the roof of the power plant. In an  interview with ABC News , Zelenskyy said Russia could stage an explosion at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to halt Ukrainian advances on the battlefield. But experts say the cold shutdown of the plant&#x27;s six reactors has largely curbed much of the risk that could come from an explosion at the nuclear power plant. A satellite image of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Southern Ukraine, July 5, 2023. AP MORE: Zelenskyy to ABC: Russia could sabotage nuclear power plant to halt Ukrainian advances Russian troops stormed and took control of the plant on March 4, 2022. Despite Ukraine&#x27;s energy company still operating the power plant, Russia has at times limited access to parts of the plant, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Last October, the IAEA said  there are mines along the perimeter of the Zaporizhzhia power plant , but not inside it. On Friday, IAEA experts at the site of the power plant were given additional access to the plant and reported that they have not observed any visible indications of mines or explosives, according to Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. But, the IAEA said the experts still need additional access to the plant. Rafael Mariano Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, speaks during an interview in Tokyo, Japan, July 7, 2023. Shuji Kajiyama/AP Alberque said that the IAEA has enough access to the plant to theoretically be able to see if Russia was taking steps to blow up the plant from the inside. However, he said warnings from Ukrainian officials should be taken seriously. Experts say the threat should be taken seriously. How could Russia blow up the plant? Alberque said there are four areas in the plant that Russia could be planning to attack: They could blow up the dry fuel storage, blow up the wet fuel storage, blow up one of the reactor buildings itself or try to melt the nuclear fuel that&#x27;s still in the reactor. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, seen from the Ukrainian city of Nikopol on July 7, 2023. The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog said on July 7, 2023 that it was making progress on inspecting several areas of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, after claims it had been mined. Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images MORE: Strategically vital Nova Khakovka dam blown up near border with Ukraine and Russia-controlled Crimea infamous meltdowns With the IAEA on site, Alberque said this is not currently a credible scenario. Alberque said the IAEA is monitoring the reactors very closely and it is still a fully functioning facility so it would be hard to plan such an explosion from inside without IAEA&#x27;s on-site team seeing it. The least dangerous of the four scenarios, blowing up the dry fuel storage, would impact people in the direct downwind, who would have an increased risk of cancer in their lifetime, Alberque said. The most dangerous scenario would be to blow up the reactor vessel inside the building itself, Alberque said. This would be similar to what Russia did when it blew up Kakhovka Dam, a  strategically vital dam and hydroelectric power plant , in June. First responders attend anti-radiation drills to prepare for an emergency situation at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, June 29, 2023. Reuters Chernobyl, also a nuclear power plant in Ukraine,  melted down in April 1986 during a safety test. The  Fukushima meltdown took place in March 2011 when a massive earthquake caused a tsunami that damaged the plant on the east coast of Japan. How damaging could an explosion of the plant be? Alberque said any explosion at Zaporizhzhia would be far less damaging than the dam that was blown up by Russia last month. More than 100 people were killed when the dam in Kherson was blown up in late June, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images MORE: Zelenskyy to ABC: Russia could sabotage nuclear power plant to halt Ukrainian advances The American Nuclear Society released similar guidance, saying the reactors being shutdown limits the risk of fallout from an explosion.  &quot;Our experts have carefully considered &#x27;worst case scenarios,&#x27; including bombardment and deliberate sabotage of the reactors and spent fuel storage canisters. They cannot foresee a situation that would result in radiation-related health consequences to the public,&quot; the American Nuclear Society said in a statement this week. The American Nuclear Society said with the reactors shutdown for over 10 months, they are not making enough heat to prompt a radiological release.  &quot;ZNPP is designed to withstand natural and man-made hazards. Thick, steel-reinforced concrete containment buildings protect the reactor cores and are designed to keep any radioactive materials isolated from the environment,&quot; the American Nuclear Society said.   Residents pass along a street in Nikopol, with the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the background, behind an expanse of sand exposed after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam, in Ukraine, on July 3, 2023. The New York Times via Redux Alberque said people living within 20 miles of the reactor should be aware of safety procedures. In the event of a warning that something has occurred, they should go inside, close the windows and try to recirculate air from the inside. Anyone who is outside should completely remove their clothes and completely wash down everything as quickly as possible."

Perhaps they have some other scenario,” Zelensky speculated.  But on one point, he was unequivocal: “In any case, the world sees – can’t but see – that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is Russia and no one else.” Russian President Vladimir Putin has long flirted with the  nuclear specter since mounting his invasion of Ukraine. Zelensky has now raised the prospect that he may cause a nuclear incident not by firing warheads, but by turning the ZNPP itself into a weapon. But what would happen if the explosives that Ukraine claims to have found were detonated? Could Zaporizhzhia become another Chernobyl? And what good, if any, would this do for Russia in its war on Ukraine?  Here’s what you need to know. What is the current situation? In June, Zelensky said Ukrainian intelligence had “received information that Russia is considering a scenario of a terrorist attack at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP),” and that the alleged attack would involve “radiation leakage.”  Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, told state TV that the Russians had mined the Zaporizhzhia plant. “The most horrifying part is that a cooler is mined. If they disable it by blowing it up… there is a great chance that there will be significant problems.” The Kremlin  denied the allegations Zelensky significantly escalated this rhetoric in his address on Tuesday night. “The whole world must now realize that common security depends entirely on global attention to the actions of the occupiers at the plant,” he said. As Ukraine’s counteroffensive attempts to reclaim territory captured by Russia, including in the Zaporizhzhia region, analysts have said that Russia may be mounting a false flag operation – a military action designed to look like it was perpetrated by the opponent. That is, Russia may claim that any explosion at the power plant was the result of reckless Ukrainian shelling, rather than its own explosives. Throughout the war, Russia has warned that Ukrainian shelling around the plant could lead to a radioactive incident. “It’s rhetorical signaling meant to accuse Ukraine of nuclear irresponsibility, and then also to discourage Ukraine from conducting counteroffensive operations into the occupied Zaporizhzhia oblast,” Karolina Hird, a Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, told CNN. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that the situation at the plant is “quite tense,” but tried to deflect criticism, claiming that the potential for “sabotage by the Kyiv regime” is “high” and could have “catastrophic consequences.” “Therefore, of course, all measures are being taken to counter this threat,” Peskov said. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) – the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog – said in an update Wednesday that there were no visible indications of mines or explosives at the ZNPP, but requested additional access to the site for confirmation. “Access to the rooftops of reactor units 3 and 4 is essential, as well as access to the turbine halls and some parts of the cooling system of the plant,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in a statement. Who controls the power plant? The ZNPP – the largest in Europe – lies along the banks of the Dnipro River, next to the town of Enerhodar. It has been under full Russian control since March last year, but is operated mostly by Ukrainian staff, who were initially  forced to work at “gunpoint” by invading Russian troops, according to Petro Kotin, head of Ukraine’s nuclear power operator Energoatom. When the war began on February 24 2022, one of the plant’s six reactor units was closed for maintenance. After Russian forces took control of the plant, the Ukrainian workers shut down the remaining units. But  fighting continued to rage around the plant last summer, to the grave alarm of the IAEA. Grossi, claiming that “every principle of nuclear safety” had been “violated” at the plant, managed to  secure his staff a visit to the site in August, while it remained under Russian control. Grossi points on a map of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, March 2022. Joe Klamar/AFP/Getty Images/File Grossi’s “personal diplomacy,” and the “bravery” of the staff who accompanied him on this visit, played a huge role in decreasing the chance of a nuclear accident at the plant, according to William Alberque, Director of Strategy, Technology and Arms Control at the International Institute for Strategy Studies. “What Grossi is doing is completely unprecedented in the history of the IAEA,” Alberque told CNN. “The whole thing was saying: Russia’s basically going to have to kill me, in order for me not to make this nuclear power plant more safe. It was astonishing.” The IAEA staff’s mission, Alberque said, was to “establish a precedent here, that we’re willing to get involved and to try to take this chess piece off the board.” Is the plant still active? Russian occupiers, however, continued to prevent Ukrainian operators from putting each of the reactors into a safer “cold shutdown” status. This means when the reactor’s temperature is below boiling point but electrical pumps moving water through the core must still keep working to cool the fuel and avoid meltdown – which requires an external power supply. The safety of the plant was threatened further by the breach of the Nova Kakhovka dam on June 6, which lowered water levels used for cooling the plant precipitously. Ukraine accused Russia of  deliberately destroying the dam – a claim that Moscow has denied. Shortly after this, the final reactor unit at ZNPP was put into cold shutdown status on June 8. Hence, due to the actions of the IAEA and Ukrainian operating staff, the plant has been put into a more stable “cold shutdown” mode, limiting the chances of a large-scale nuclear disaster.

Because the plant’s reactors have been cooled, no. If the reported explosives were to detonate, this would “open up a cold reactor, which would expose spent fuel to the air, which will spread some radiation,” Alberque told CNN. “A plume will come off from the reactor where there will be radiation aerosolized,” he said. This would create a radiation zone where “you’ll have a higher chance of cancer over the next 40 years,” but will not recreate the sort of destruction seen after the meltdown of the active Chernobyl plant in 1986. “The six reactors at ZNPP are not at all like the Chernobyl reactor and cannot, CAN NOT, have the same kind of accident,” Cheryl Rofer, a nuclear expert and former researcher at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, wrote in a blog. “Chernobyl had a graphite moderator, and the building it was in was not the heavily reinforced concrete of the reactors at ZNPP. The ZNPP reactors have hard oxide fuel encased in metal, and are inside a stainless steel vessel. Chernobyl had no such vessel,” she added. According to Alberque, the scale of the effects of any disaster at Zaporizhzhia would be more akin to that at  Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979, rather than Chernobyl (1986) – or even  Fukushima Rescuers attend an anti-radiation drill on June 29, in case of an emergency at the ZNPP. Stringer/Reuters Would a nuclear incident benefit Russia? It is unclear how Russia would benefit from causing an explosion at the plant. “The winds are blowing east. So it’s going to affect Russians. In terms of military effectiveness: Zero. It’s just stupid,” Alberque said. Any nuclear incident would “just be self-harm. It would just harm Russian-held territory… I don’t get the play.” As well as not providing clear military strategic gains for Russia, causing a nuclear incident may backfire diplomatically. The Financial Times  reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping has personally warned Putin against using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, according to Western and Chinese officials.  The Kremlin denied the report, calling it “fiction.” However, it adds to the sense that Russia’s continued nuclear threats are causing reputational damage among its supposed allies. Warring parties do not tend to raise the nuclear specter lightly. India and Pakistan, despite being locked in conflict for decades, agreed in 1988 to exclude nuclear facilities from their conflict zones, recognizing the risk that such attacks pose. They have exchanged a list of their nuclear facilities every year since 1992 to avoid any accidents. Hence Russia’s reckless threats may contribute to further isolation on the world stage. “If Putin were to do this [cause an explosion at the ZNPP], how does India – whose line is, ‘unlike Pakistan, we’re the responsible nuclear power’ – how do they say that if we’re friends with the guy who just blew up a nuclear power plant?” Alberque said."

By  Fredrick Kunkle and Kostiantyn Khudov July 2, 2023 at 1:00 a.m. EDT Listen 8 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share TOMAKIVKA, Ukraine — The risk of a major disaster at the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant terrifies Nadiya Hez, who lives in an area that would probably take the brunt of any deadly radioactive fallout. The nuclear plant has been in continual danger as Russian and Ukrainian troops trade fire in its vicinity, but the chance of a meltdown has increased sharply since the destruction of the Kakhovka dam just downstream. The June 6 breach unleashed a catastrophic flood and jeopardized the supply of water needed to cool the plant’s reactors and spent fuel. Advertisement But there have been so many horrors since Russia invaded last year that Hez and others in this Ukrainian town have responded to the threat of a nuclear disaster with a mix of dread and hardened fatalism. Hez, who is a nurse, at least has iodine tablets on hand to mitigate the effects of radiation poisoning. After days of searching, she located a key to the root cellar outside their Soviet-era home that could serve as a crude fallout shelter for her, her husband and their 1-year-old son, Ihor, should radiation escape from the Russian-held nuclear power plant about 22 miles away. There has been little else to do except wait and focus on the daily hardships the war has already inflicted upon their lives. Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remaining  “It’s horrible — I don’t even want to think about it,” Hez, 22, said while juggling her baby and several heavy water jugs from a charity’s roving tanker truck. The town’s municipal water system was knocked out when the dam went. Warnings from Ukrainian officials and atomic energy experts about a potential disaster in southeastern Ukraine have gained urgency since the dam’s breach. Ukrainian officials accuse Russian forces of deliberately blowing up part of the dam, an allegation Moscow has denied. What to know about Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant As far back as October, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky predicted that Russia would destroy the dam. Now, Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian officials have upped the tempo of warnings that Russian forces plan to sabotage the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest such facility in Europe. Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, who heads Ukraine’s military intelligence, said through a spokesman that Russians have planted explosives next to four of the six reactors and mined the cooling pond used to supply water to chill the reactors and spent fuel. “There is an extremely high risk of human error or, given the amount of explosives, an accidental detonation,” spokesman Andriy Yusov said. On Friday, the military intelligence agency issued an ominous update, saying that the three Russian supervisors had evacuated and Ukrainian employees signed to work for the Russian state nuclear power conglomerate should depart by July 5. The report also said that personnel remaining behind had been told to “blame Ukraine in case of any emergencies.” Advertisement Earlier this week, Ihor Klymenko, who heads the Ministry of Internal Affairs, announced training exercises at all levels of government to deal with a possible nuclear disaster. These have included planning for evacuations within a certain radius of the plant, road closures and the creation of checkpoints to screen people for radiation exposure. For residents unable to evacuate in time, officials have urged sheltering in place, making sure to shut off ventilation and air conditioners and seal up windows with dampened cloth and tape. When outdoors, he said, people should wear masks that can filter out airborne radioactive dust and other particles. IAEA chief pushes plan to secure nuclear plant ahead of Ukraine offensive Klymenko and other officials have also urged the public to remain calm — advice that many Ukrainians seem to have taken to heart, despite their country’s history with Chernobyl, the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster, and nine years of violent conflict with Russia. “People are already hardened, resilient,” said Yuriy Malashko, the head of the Zaporizhzhia region’s military administration.

All six reactors have since been shut down. The plant has had several close calls, including from repeated artillery strikes that cut the electric lines maintaining its cooling operations. It is now faced with a dwindling supply of water because of the dam breach. After the construction of the plant in the 1980s, the reservoir of the Kakhovka dam was used to fill the holding pond cooling its reactors and spent fuel. As of June 24, the pond’s water level stands at about 16 meters (52 feet) — only four meters above the minimum level necessary to cool the plant, said Olena Pareniuk, a senior researcher at Ukraine’s National Academy of Sciences who has studied nuclear power plant disasters. The situation led the International Atomic Energy Agency’s general director to conduct an emergency inspection of the nuclear plant days after the dam breach. In a statement posted on the IAEA’s website, Rafael Mariano Grossi said the  cooling pond is being replenished with water from a discharge channel at a nearby coal-fired power plant and from a drainage system fed by underground water. At the current rate of evaporation — about four inches a day, Grossi estimated that the plant has enough water for “many weeks.” He also said he saw no evidence it had been mined. Photos: Deal 'evolving' to protect Ukrainian nuclear plant at risk of catastrophe Just as concerning, however, is the added pressure on remaining Ukrainian staff, Pareniuk said. Perhaps only 3,000 of its 11,000 employees are left to oversee its operations — “barely enough” to keep the plant safe in a shutdown state and far too few for an emergency. “The threat of a terrorist attack is high,” said a Ukrainian employee still working at the plant, whom The Washington Post is not naming to protect his safety. He said the plant has already reduced the amount of water used to cool the reactors — the hottest of which, according to Pareniuk, is still at about 536 degrees Fahrenheit even after being shut down. Advertisement Ukrainian officials and atomic energy experts warn that without sufficient cooling, a reactor’s core could overheat, allowing the buildup of an explosive mixture of hydrogen gas and steam that could rupture the containment structure and blow dangerous amounts of radiation into the air. The reactors could melt down anywhere from 10 hours to two weeks without water, Budanov said. What could happen then? Pareniuk and other experts said it is unlikely to be anything like Chernobyl, which blew when the reactor was in active operation. She said the most likely worst-case scenario could be something on scale with the  Fukushima disaster in 2011, when fuel in three of the Japanese nuclear plant’s four reactors melted down following a massive earthquake and tsunami. If so, a poisonous cloud could spread across Ukraine, contaminating its agricultural heartland and probably drifting over European neighbors with radioactive particles that increase the risk of certain cancers. Radioactive contamination is likely to reach the Dnieper River, too, flowing into the Black Sea. Depending on water currents, the contamination could touch every country along the Black Sea’s shores, Pareniuk said. As a bio-radiologist, she understands in detail what that could mean for her and her 4-year-old child, though they live far away, west of the capital, Kyiv. “I’m terrified,” she said. So are many people in this small town, located at the edge of the potential 20-mile exclusion zone around the plant. That’s the radius of the no man’s land that still exists around the Chernobyl plant. Even before the dam break, Hez had already been through a lot. She gave birth in a hospital bunker in Nikopol as Russian artillery pounded the city. Constant shelling there forced her and her husband, Oleksiy, 23, to relocate here with their baby, where they subsist on state assistance as displaced people and the parents of a child — about $135 a month. Advertisement Both have been contacted by the military’s draft officials, one of whom told her she would have to put her baby in the care of his grandmother or someone else because her services are needed. “It’s like a horror movie,” said Vita Lyashenko, 47, a nurse waiting in line with about 50 other people to collect drinking water in the center of town. Like others, she has been gathering rainwater, recycling water for household chores and going longer without showers since the municipal water system went down after the dam breach. She has also set aside iodine tablets, extra water and tape to seal her windows against radioactive fallout. Olena Mykytiuk, 59, who lives on disability while caring for her ailing husband, said she, too, has iodine pills but isn’t sure whether she wants to take them. She also worries about what might happen to her chickens. “We don’t know how to prepare ourselves for radiation,” Mykytiuk said. “We are watching the news, and we know all they need to do is to press a button.”"

Should the world be worried?﻿ The drastic warnings have fueled rising concern among residents in southeastern Ukraine and beyond. But some experts told NBC News that the risk of a widespread radiation leak was low. Kyiv and Moscow trade allegations over Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant 01:22 Get more news Live on NBC News Now Print July 5, 2023, 2:11 PM UTC  /  Updated July 5, 2023, 3:12 PM UTC By  Alexander Smith It sounds like a doomsday nightmare:  Europe’s largest nuclear power plant stuck in the middle of a war zone , now allegedly wired with explosives ready to spread a radiological catastrophe across the continent. Ukraine’s  Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been a constant source of dread since it was  captured by Russia in March 2022 in  the early days of  its invasion. A drumbeat of warnings from Kyiv and Moscow has grown in recent weeks, crescendoing late Tuesday with each side accusing the other of planning an imminent attack designed to frame its warring rival. The increasingly drastic warnings have  fueled rising concern among residents in southeastern Ukraine and beyond — not least given  the destruction of the huge dam that had previously been a source of similar alarm and accusations. But some experts told NBC News that the risk of a widespread radiation leak was low. “It is actually quite difficult to arrange a significant reactive incident here,” said Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva. “Even if you try to blow it up, I don’t think you could spread” the radiation beyond a few hundred yards. Ukraine has warned for months that  Russia might try to blow up the nuclear plant . But rarely have these warnings been as specific as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was late Tuesday, when he said Russia had placed “objects resembling explosives” on the roof — perhaps intending to blame an attack on Ukraine. “It is the responsibility of everyone in the world to stop it,” he said, in his latest appeal for more assistance from allies. “No one can stand aside as radiation affects everyone.” The Kremlin has presented its own version of events.  President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Wednesday that the Russian-controlled plant was at risk of “sabotage” by Ukraine. The deputy adviser at the Russian energy giant Rosenergoatom, Renat Karchaa, said Ukraine was planning to strike the plant with a tactical ballistic missile tipped with a nuclear waste-filled warhead, Russia's state-owned news agency RIA Novosti reported Tuesday. NBC News has not verified the claims of either side. The International Atomic Energy Agency has issued regular warnings about the danger of fighting around a nuclear plant. It said in a statement Wednesday that partial inspections had revealed no evidence of mines or other explosives, but that it had not been granted access to the whole site. It added that no shelling or explosions have been reported recently and that the military presence at the site appeared unchanged. The IAEA says it has been given partial access to inspect the plant, shown here last month. AFP - Getty Images This part of the world doesn’t need to imagine what nuclear catastrophe looks like.  Around 340 miles northwest of Zaporizhzhia,  the meltdown of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986 remains the worst of its kind on record. Some 200,000 people were evacuated, radioactive material was blown across the Northern Hemisphere, and scientists say a 19-mile exclusion zone may not be safe for 24,000 years, the half-life of the plutonium-239 released. Though officially fewer than 50 people died, the meltdown resulted in a “far higher than normal” rate of thyroid cancer among children in the area, according to the IAEA. Comparisons are inevitable then, particularly given that  Zaporizhzhia is almost twice the size of Chernobyl and finds itself in the midst of a modern land war. Ukrainian emergency workers, such as this person clad in protective gear last week, have been training in the event of an incident at the nuclear plant. Evgeniy Maloletka / AP Many in eastern Ukraine have felt increasing panic this week, fueled by a fervent rumor mill on the popular Telegram messaging app, which residents check throughout the night.  The country's deputy defense minister, Hanna Maliar, said Wednesday that emergency services across four regions had been doing days of extra training to cope with \"a possible terrorist attack\" on the plant. These fears were hardly tempered last week when local Russian-installed government officials said they had evacuated 1,600 people, including 660 children, from the area around the plant. The area has also already seen what happens when a colossal piece of vital infrastructure is destroyed.  Last month, farther down the Dnieper River,  the Kakhovka dam burst , apparently following an explosion, flooding homes and forcing thousands of residents to flee while threatening an \"ecological catastrophe.\"  Zelenskyy himself said the muted international reaction to this — he blames Russia but his allies have not publicly apportioned blame — “may incite the Kremlin to commit new evil.” Zaporizhzhia was captured in the early days of the war by Russian soldiers, who have guarded it ever since. The region is on the front lines of Ukraine&#x27;s counteroffensive. AP file Most experts agree that any nuclear power plant should be off-limits in conflict. But some disagree about how bad an explosion at Zaporizhzhia would be in terms of a widespread nuclear disaster. “If you blow up nuclear fuel, you’re going to get contamination,” said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, the former commander of Britain's and NATO’s chemical, biological and nuclear defense forces. “You’re not going to get a nuclear explosion, but the fires potentially created could spread contamination, as happened at Chernobyl.” Zaporizhzhia is more modern than Chernobyl, built in the early 1980s, around 10 years after construction of its infamous cousin began. And de Bretton-Gordon said its far more sturdy design, aimed at withstanding being hit by a jetliner, means the risk would come only from a blast inside the facility itself. But other experts have said that fundamental differences between the design of two plants means that the risk of widespread radiation contamination is low regardless. The training for Ukrainian emergency workers this weekend involved treating people who might be affected by an emergency at the facility.  Evgeniy Maloletka / AP The Zaporizhzhia plant's reactors are housed inside stainless steel containment vessels, which themselves are placed inside walls of thick, reinforced concrete. Unlike Chernobyl, its design does not use graphite, the material that caught fire in the 1986 incident and spread radioactive material into the atmosphere. Zaporizhzhia’s six reactors “are not at all like the Chernobyl reactor and cannot, CAN NOT, have the same kind of accident,”  wrote Cheryl Rofer , a retired nuclear researcher who worked for more than 30 years at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the U.S. government facility in New Mexico. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, agreed it was \"unlikely that limited Russian sabotage\" at Zaporizhzhia \"would be able to generate a massive radiological incident.\" Perhaps most crucially, all six of Zaporizhzhia’s reactors are currently in cold shutdown, meaning they are far cooler than those in Chernobyl or Fukushima, the plant that melted down following Japan’s earthquake and tsunami in 2011. \"I don't think these accusations and counteraccusations are very helpful,\" said Podvig, at the U.N. Institute for Disarmament Research. “The message should be that the plant should be off limits for any military action — and I would probably say for propaganda, too.”"

When Putin launched his invasion nearly one year ago, he thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided. He thought he could outlast us. But he was dead wrong. Today, in Kyiv, I am meeting with President Zelenskyy and his team for an extended discussion on our support for Ukraine. I will announce another delivery of critical equipment, including artillery ammunition, anti-armor systems, and air surveillance radars to help protect the Ukrainian people from aerial bombardments. And I will share that later this week, we will announce additional sanctions against elites and companies that are trying to evade or backfill Russia’s war machine. Over the last year, the United States has built a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific to help defend Ukraine with unprecedented military, economic, and humanitarian support – and that support will endure. I also look forward to traveling on to Poland to meet President Duda and the leaders of our Eastern Flank Allies, as well as deliver remarks on how the United States will continue to rally the world to support the people of Ukraine and the core values of human rights and dignity in the UN Charter that unite us worldwide."

      "Text": "Ukraine war: Kyiv not to blame for Poland missile - Zelensky Published 17 November 2022 comments Comments Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image source,  Getty Images By Patrick Jackson and Oliver Slow BBC News, London President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he had &quot;no doubts&quot; that Ukraine was not to blame for the missile strike that killed two people in Poland on Tuesday. He also called for Ukrainian officials to be allowed to access the blast site and to be part of the investigation. His comments came as Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Kyiv&#x27;s air defence missiles were &quot;most likely&quot; to blame.  The missile blast occurred on a farm in Przewodow, just 6km (4 miles) from Poland&#x27;s border with Ukraine. Ukrainian air defence systems were activated on Tuesday when Russia launched what is believed to be its biggest wave of missile strikes since its February invasion.  The attack, which occurred during the G20 summit in Indonesia, caused an international outcry, while news of a missile blast inside Nato member Poland&#x27;s territory raised fears of a dangerous escalation in the war. But Polish President Andrzej Duda said it was &quot;highly probable&quot; that the missile was launched by Ukrainian anti-aircraft defence.  Mr Stoltenberg told the BBC that he agreed with Poland&#x27;s assessment that the incident was probably caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile.  He added that Nato had pledged to supply a &quot;more advanced air defence system&quot; to Ukraine, which is not a member of the alliance but receives extensive military aid. And Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said Russia bore ultimate responsibility for the incident.  Meanwhile, the top US general has warned that an early military victory for Ukraine remains unlikely, despite a series of successful Ukrainian counter-offensives in the east and south. Last week, Ukraine recaptured Kherson, the only major city to fall to Russia since it started its invasion in February. And in the east, a Ukrainian offensive launched in September has seen Kyiv&#x27;s forces advance into Donestsk and Luhansk.  But he said recent Russian losses meant a &quot;political solution&quot; was possible. Gen Milley, who serves as President Biden&#x27;s top military adviser, said the Ukrainian gains had left Russia &quot;on its back&quot; and observed that its losses could see Moscow agree to some sort of a political withdrawal.  But the top US general did not elaborate as to what that agreement would look like.  Speaking to attendees of the G20 summit in Bali earlier this week, President Zelensky laid out a 10-point peace plan that includes nuclear safety guarantees, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine&#x27;s territory, and reparations and justice for &quot;Russia&#x27;s aggression against Ukraine&quot;.  But Moscow&#x27;s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Kyiv&#x27;s demands were &quot;unrealistic and inadequate&quot;. He added that Ukraine &quot;categorically refuses&quot; negotiations with Russia.  Elsewhere, the eastern Donetsk region has seen heavy fighting in recent days, according to Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych.  He said Russian troops from Kherson region had now been &quot;redirected&quot; towards Donetsk and Luhansk."

      "Text": "For Maryna Prylutska, Christmas will be a muted affair this year. Like other recent family occasions, it will be celebrated online, with most of her family back home in Ukraine. That is, if the electricity supply to Prylutska&#x27;s hometown is recovered following a string of Russian attacks. It is nine months now since Prylutska — who now lives in Germany with her two children — last saw her husband and parents. And for Prylutska, and the millions of others who have fled Russia&#x27;s invasion this year, the holidays are proving especially hard. We Ukrainians are willing to do whatever it takes to defend our children. Maryna Prylutska She and her husband had been considering leaving Ukraine since the onset of the war on Feb. 24. But with no friends abroad to stay with, she was reluctant to move to a shelter with her daughter, 12, and son, four. Then, one day in March, she received a phone call from her former father-in-law who had encountered a potential host while transporting his own children to Germany. There was a shared home available to her and her children in Bonn, if she wanted it. Maryna Prylutska&#x27;s children, 12 and 4, adjust to their new home in Bonn, Germany after leaving their small hometown in central Ukraine. Maryna Prylutska By that point, Russian troops were just 80 kilometers (50 miles) from her hometown, a small locale of 16,000 people in the center of Ukraine, and her options were limited. Within days, she and her children were being driven overland to Germany, where they are currently living in their contact&#x27;s house with four other Ukrainian women and their six children. Ukrainian refugees near 8 million Prylutska is one of more than  7.8 million Ukrainians — around one-fifth of the population — who have fled the country for Europe since Russia&#x27;s invasion. Some 2.8 million have entered Russia, including via Moscow&#x27;s forcible transfer program, while the vast majority have relocated West, primarily to neighboring Poland, which has taken in 1.5 million refugees. That includes 27-year-old trauma therapist, Kateryna Shukh. For the past seven years, since the start of Russia and Ukraine&#x27;s 2014 Donbas war, she has been working with female refugees at Bereginya — Mariupol Women&#x27;s Association. Now, she finds herself one among them. I work with refugees, and I continue to do my work, but I am now a refugee, too. Kateryna Shukh vice president, Bereginya - Mariupol Women&#x27;s Association Aside from offering psychological support and art therapy to the women and children hosted in temporary housing, part of Shukh&#x27;s role is to provide information to help refugees navigate the myriad resettlement schemes of host countries. Kateryna Shukh, center, says she has found solace in supporting other Ukrainian refugees by hosting art therapy sessions from her new home in Warsaw, Poland. Kateryna Shukh In Poland, for example, Ukrainian refugees have the legal right to remain for 18 months, with the possibility of applying for a three-year temporary residence permit. Financial grants, meanwhile, are available for families and certain vulnerable groups. Still, rapidly depleting housing and employment options are causing some Ukrainians to consider returning home, Shukh said. She recalled one mother who recently took her five-year-old daughter back to their windowless home in an occupied part of Ukraine because she was unable to find work. Countries revise their refugee support Others still are relocating elsewhere across the continent. But hastily designed resettlement programs mean that some countries are now coming under pressure. In the U.K., for example, the government launched a  Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme weeks into the invasion, offering a &quot;thank you&quot; payment of £350 per month to households willing to commit to hosting one or more refugees for at least six months. The scheme has so far housed 108,000 people, while a further 42,600 have arrived in Britain to stay with relatives. But 10 months on, and with no end to the war in sight, some are wondering how long the arrangement might last. There is an urgent need to find practical solutions to the issues facing Ukrainian migrants and host families. Kate Brown CEO, Reset Communities and Refugees The situation is further complicated by the fact that many Ukrainians have settled into relatively well-off, middle-class areas, from which it can be difficult to relocate to affordable housing. Kate Brown, CEO of Reset Communities and Refugees, which helps rehouse refugees in the U.K., said that the number of Britons offering up their homes to migrants has dropped over time. As of Dec. 6, the charity had 227 potential hosts registered on its database, but 3,948 active Ukrainian cases — which can represent one or more individuals — looking for homes. Yuliia Matalinets, right, a cargo surveyor from Odessa, photographed with her host, left, in Bristol, England. Yuliia Matalinets The U.K. government revised its scheme last week, announcing  £150 million in additional funding for local authorities to help Ukrainian guests move into their own homes. Hosts who extend their support beyond the first year of sponsorship will also receive increased &quot;thank you&quot; payments of £500 under the new measures. That&#x27;s welcome news to some hosts, who say tandem crises in the U.K. have weighed on their ability to support their guests. Still, for many arrivals like Matalinets — thankful as she is for her hosts, whom she describes as similar to her parents — the sooner she can get home to her boyfriend and her family, the better."

Monthly payments for families who have hosted refugees for a year are to rise from £350 to £500 in 2023, ministers said last week. But that would come too late amid the cost of living crisis, Miranda Allen, a host in Sheffield, has said. The Homes for Ukraine scheme, which was launched in March, allowed Ukrainians who were fleeing the war with Russia to come to the UK - if a sponsor agreed to provide accommodation for at least six months. Last week, the government  announced an increase in the payments made to sponsors , but the higher amount of £500 will be paid only when the Ukrainian guest has been in the UK for a year. This means increased payments will not be issued to sponsors until March 2023 at the earliest. Image caption,  Some councils, including Leeds and Calderdale, have said they would pay host households an additional £150 to bridge the gap before the government support began. But many other local authorities, including Sheffield, have not made that pledge. The cleaner and bushcraft instructor said she was able to continue hosting Liudyma Sheleft, 43, and son Illia, 15, who fled Kyiv after Russia&#x27;s invasion of their country in February. She said living alongside them had been &quot;amazing&quot; and the pair were now &quot;part of the family&quot; for her and her 10-year-old son. But she said she knew of other families whose sponsorship arrangements were breaking down as energy and food costs surged. Ms Allen warned: &quot;People just literally cannot afford to keep doing it because you get the same money whether you&#x27;re hosting a single person or a family of five. Image source,  REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach Image caption,  The Homes for Ukraine scheme allows Ukrainians fleeing the war with Russia to come to the UK Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, sponsors took in refugees for an initial six months and had no obligation to extend their stay. Nearly 3,000 of the 100,000 refugees who arrived in the UK under the scheme or family visa schemes had since become homeless, according the latest government figures published this month. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said it had allocated £150m funding to councils across the UK to support Ukrainian refugees to move into their own homes and reduce the risk of homelessness. But many Ukrainians still face a struggle to secure private rental homes without employment or credit history in the UK. Leeds City Council said it would consider requests to cover bonds or deposits to help refugees find their own homes.  Bradford Council said it was preparing to offer grants to help Ukrainians afford moving into new accommodation.  The council did not have sufficient funds to increase payments to host families, a spokesperson for the authority said."

REUTERS/Remo Casilli BUDAPEST, April 29 (Reuters) - Pope Francis met Ukrainian refugees on the second day of his visit to Hungary on Saturday, telling them a different future was possible as they described the hardships they have faced since the war began. Francis met about 600 refugees, poor and homeless people in a visit to a Budapest church a day after warning of the dangers  of rising nationalism in Europe and telling the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban that accepting migrants along with the rest of the continent would be a true sign of Christianity. Francis was serenaded by a singing band of Hungarian Roma wearing flower-patterned clothing and seemed to enjoy the music as they hovered around him while he sat in his wheelchair. Earlier, he listened as one refugee, Oleg Yakovlev, told him how he and his wife, Lyudmila, and their five children had to leave their home city of Dnipro a year ago after Russian bombings. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, millions of refugees have fled through Central Europe, including Hungary, and moved to other countries. About 35,000 have applied for temporary protection status in Hungary. Francis, echoing his speech on Friday, said expressing compassion for those suffering from poverty and tragedy is an integral part of being a Christian, even if those in need are non-believers. In the afternoon, Francis addressed 12,000 young people at a sports arena, smiling as he was presented with one of modern Hungary&#x27;s most famous inventions - a Rubik&#x27;s cube. In a move significant for inter-religious dialogue, the pope also met with Metropolitan (bishop) Hilarion, representative of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) in Budapest, who was  effectively ousted from the number two post at ROC headquarters in Moscow last year following internal differences on Ukraine. ROC Patriarch Kirill is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and fully backs the war as a bulwark against a West he describes as decadent. The European Union tried to put Kirill on its sanctions list last year but member states failed to find unanimity on the issue as Hungary opposed his inclusion.

A view shows an office building of a car retailer destroyed during a Russian missile attack in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine October 11, 2022 [Sergiy Chalyi/Reuters] Published On 11 Oct 2022 11 Oct 2022 The United Nations refugee chief has warned that more people will be forced to flee their homes in Ukraine after Russia  conducted air attacks on multiple cities across Ukraine including the capital Kyiv. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees spoke on Monday in Geneva on the sidelines of the Nansen Refugee Award ceremony, which this year  went to former German Chancellor Angela Merkel “The horror of what happened in Ukraine today … is inexcusable,” Filippo Grandi told journalists. Russia’s wave of cruise missile attacks followed an explosion on the  strategically-important Kerch bridge that links it with Crimea, the Ukrainian territory it annexed in 2014. “The bombing of civilians, of houses … of non-military infrastructure in an indiscriminate manner in many cities across Ukraine, means the war is becoming harder and more difficult for civilians,” Grandi said. “I fear that the events of these last hours will provoke more displacements.” Also on Monday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply shocked” by  the raids , according to a spokesman. “This constitutes another unacceptable escalation of the war and, as always, civilians are paying the highest price,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. Ukrainian authorities said Russia fired 84 missiles at 10 cities, 56 of which were neutralised by air defences. At least 19 people were killed in the attacks, which also wounded dozens, according to Ukraine’s emergency services. Internal displacement Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, more than 7.6 million Ukrainian refugees have been recorded across Europe. While some of them have since returned, more than 4.2 million Ukrainians have registered for temporary protection status in European Union countries. Another nearly seven million people have been displaced within the conflict-torn country, according to the UN’s International Organization for Migration. “My prognosis … is that we will mainly see internal displacements,” Grandi said. “You have people who flee for only a few hours, to escape the bombs… and then try to return home,” he said. But in situations where destruction is greater, and people can no longer access heat or food, “I fear the displacements will last longer”, he said."

A year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked the largest conflict in Europe since World War II, the repercussions continue to reverberate around the world. Not only has the war in Ukraine set off a geopolitical realignment, but it has caused economic hardship far from the epicenter of the fighting. The Feb. 24, 2022, invasion has touched off a refugee crisis, as Ukrainians flee the conflict in their homeland and many Russian men seek to avoid conscription. Meanwhile, it has spurred a process toward expanding NATO, with Finland and Sweden pursuing membership after decades of official neutrality. Loading...  Ukraine and Russia are key exporters of wheat, barley, corn and cooking oil, particularly to African and Middle Eastern countries. Turkey and the United Nations brokered a  deal last summer to allow Ukrainian grain to pass through Black Sea ports, but Russia is reportedly  still hindering shipments . Russia is also a major producer of fertilizer and petroleum. Disruptions to the flow of these goods are compounding other supply chain and climate challenges, driving up food and gas prices and causing shortages in places such as  Chad ,  Tunisia and  Sri Lanka Loading...  Loading...  More than  8 million refugees have fled Ukraine in what the  World Health Organization describes as \"the largest movement of people in the European Region since the Second World War.\" Many have been involuntarily  relocated by Russia. Others have put a strain on resources, as well as schools and hospitals, in  Poland and  Germany Loading...  Loading...  A 21st century war in Europe — led by a nuclear power — is pushing the world toward realignment. It has rattled NATO,  the European Union and  the U.N ., forcing countries to take sides in ways that have led to escalating tensions and diplomatic shifts. For example,  Turkey , despite being a NATO member, has  increased trade with Russia since the start of the war and has thrown up objections to allowing Sweden and Finland into the alliance. Loading...  Loading...  Russia is one of the world's largest producers of oil and fuel. European countries have banned the Russian oil, gas and diesel they relied on, which initially caused a steep spike in prices. However,  moves by European nations to lock in  alternative sources , along with  conservation efforts and a mild winter, have largely alleviated those price hikes. Now prices have returned to pre-invasion levels. Loading...  Loading...  Russia has more nuclear weapons  than any other country. Its attack on Ukraine has notably reenergized NATO, with the U.S. and other member states funneling  tens of billions of dollars worth of military equipment into Ukraine. Early weapons deliveries included anti-tank rockets such as the U.S.-made Javelin. In the latest moves, the  U.S .,  Germany and  Britain have promised to provide state-of-the-art tanks."

Print European Union officials Friday pledged continued support for millions of Ukrainian refugees, as they marked the  anniversary of the Russian invasion .  “Ukraine can win this war, but we will be with Ukraine as long as it takes,” EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson told the Associated Press on the sidelines of a conference on migration near Athens.  Johansson urged members to conclude long-running negotiations to adopt new EU-wide migration rules and to assist Ukrainians who wished to return home but maintain their temporary residence status in the EU.  Advertisement More than 8 million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the war, according to the United Nations refugee agency, and nearly 5 million have registered for EU temporary protection or similar national protection schemes in Europe.  Bartosz Grodecki, the Polish deputy interior minister, whose country has  taken in the most refugees traveling westward since the start of the war, said his government was prepared to receive more people who could be displaced by a widely anticipated spring offensive by Russian forces in Ukraine.  “We have this contingency planning,” Grodecki told the AP. “I hope that it will not be necessary ... [but] we’ve been trained, planned properly, and we know how to be prepared.” World &amp; Nation EU boosts funding for Ukraine amid concerns over a refugee exodus European Union leaders have given the green light to a plan to provide Ukraine with about $18 billion in financial support over the next year. Margaritis Schinas, the EU Commission vice president, said Russian President Vladimir Putin had failed in an effort to divide EU countries by applying  pressure through high energy prices and migration. “This is a sad anniversary, but it’s also an opportunity to draw some lessons from these horrible 12 months we’re leaving behind,” Schinas told the AP.  Advertisement “And as far as [refugees from] Ukraine are concerned, the figures are stable,” he said.  Schinas added that he didn’t think it was “automatic” that refugee numbers would increase in the coming months.  World &amp; Nation Europe has staved off energy collapse despite Russia’s gas cutoff. But is the crisis over? Warm weather is helping Europe keep the lights and heat on this winter despite Russia cutting off most of its natural gas supply to the continent. “If it happens, we are ready, but it doesn’t seem to be the case for the time being.”  The migration conference Friday was organized by Greece, Austria, Poland and Lithuania to discuss issues including border management problems and  border wall construction .  Officials attending the conference observed a minute of silence for the victims of the war in Ukraine."

Bernat Armangue/AP, FILE More than 8 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe as of Tuesday,  nearly one year since Russia invaded , according to  the U.N. refugee agency Poland has seen the largest numbers of Ukrainian refugees, estimated to be around 1.5 million, followed by other European countries like the Czech Republic and Slovakia, due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Celina Kretkowska-Adamowicz, director of program operations for Save the Children in Poland, told ABC News that, as of now, “the biggest need is financial support.” MORE: Russia-Ukraine war: Key events in the year since Russia invaded Ukraine Displaced Ukrainians onboard a Poland bound train in Lviv, western Ukraine, March 13, 2022. Bernat Armangue/AP, FILE Save the Children has been operating in Poland since February 2022,  when Ukraine was first invaded , Kretkowska-Adamowicz said. Though people are still crossing the border from Ukraine to Poland, “now, the situation is more stable, the movement of people is also more stable, and the needs are more longer-term,” she said. Kretkowska-Adamowicz said “child protection, education and the provision of emergency assistance through cash voucher[s]” are among some of those longer-term needs that Save the Children has been helping with. Some refugees have also attempted to move back to Ukraine, Kretkowska-Adamowicz said. “But then after a while, they find out that they are not able to live like this,” she said, “and then they decide to go back to Poland.” Of the more than  17,000 people surveyed by the U.N. from October 2022 to February that have been displaced because of the war in Ukraine, 24% said they have visited home at least once since they initially left. Some of the top reasons listed included visiting relatives and obtaining documents. “Many people from Poland go to Ukraine for a short period of time, for example, to see their family or to attend to some formal issues,” Kretkowska-Adamowicz said. Others, however, do the opposite, Kretkowska-Adamowicz said. “There are many cases of people who are crossing to Poland, for example, just to do shopping on the Polish side and then they come back to Ukraine,” she said. As more refugees are settling in host countries, education and mental health have become more prominent issues, she added. “Access to inclusive and equal education is difficult,” Kretkowska-Adamowicz said. “We are seeing as well, now, increasing issues related to mental health.”"

Текст интервью есть в распоряжении «Ленты.ру». По словам министра иностранных дел, об официальном отказе стало известно после запроса по дипломатическим каналам. Ведомство задало вопрос, означает ли решение передать комплексы  Киеву также отправку американских военнослужащих, поскольку ЗРК сложны в использовании. Нам достаточно пространно объясняли, что этого не планируется, именно потому, что американцы не хотят и не будут воевать напрямую против России Сергей Лавров глава МИД России В США пояснили, что Patriot будут вводиться в действие постепенно, по мере обучения представителей  Вооруженных сил Украины 22 декабря президент США  Джо Байден заявил , что Вашингтон поставит Киеву зенитно-ракетные комплексы Patriot. Кроме того, американский лидер пообещал обучить Вооруженные силы Украины безошибочному использованию ЗРК. Газета Politico со ссылкой на представителя  Пентагона писала , что Соединенные Штаты не передадут зенитный ракетный комплекс, пока украинские военные не пройдут обучение. Отмечалось, что система, которая включает в себя несколько вспомогательных машин со станциями управления, радарами и генераторами, скорее всего, не появится на поле боя еще много месяцев.

Ранее Лавров  заявил , что фактически страны Запада объявили России войну еще в 2014 году. «Эта война была нам объявлена достаточно давно — после того, как состоялся госпереворот на Украине, оркестрированный США и, по сути дела, поддержанный  Евросоюзом , и после того, как минские договоренности, как теперь уже окончательно выясняется, никто не собирался выполнять, госпожа [экс-канцлер  Германии Ангела] Меркель вновь [это] подтвердила», — напомнил он. Россия хотела бы завершить конфликт на Украине как можно раньше Министр иностранных дел подчеркнул, что Россия хотела бы завершить конфликт на Украине как можно раньше, однако приоритетом является защита мирных граждан.

Об этом глава  российского МИД Сергей Лавров заявил в интервью передаче «Большая игра», фрагмент которого показали в  эфире Первого канала По словам министра, против России сейчас воюет коллективный Запад во главе с  США «Эта война была нам объявлена достаточно давно — после того, как состоялся госпереворот на  Украине , оркестрированный США и, по сути дела, поддержанный  Евросоюзом , и после того, как минские договоренности, как теперь уже окончательно выясняется, никто не собирался выполнять, госпожа [экс-канцлер  Германии Ангела] Меркель вновь [это] подтвердила», — напомнил он. 7 декабря немецкая газета Die Zeit опубликовала интервью, в котором Меркель  назвала заключение Минских соглашений в 2014 году попыткой дать Украине время, чтобы страна стала сильнее. Экс-канцлер добавила, что участники соглашений уже тогда понимали, что конфликт на востоке Украины лишь заморожен, но не решен. Позже президент России  Владимир Путин заявил , что слова Меркель только подтверждают правильность решения о начале спецоперации. «Может, и раньше все это надо было начинать», — добавил он."

REUTERS/Yevhen Titov Feb 14 (Reuters) - Russia, locked in a decades-old territorial dispute with Tokyo over a chain of Pacific islands, on Tuesday accused Japan of engaging in Russophobia and mounting &quot;vicious attacks&quot; over the war in Ukraine. Soviet troops seized the islands off the northern coast of Japan at the very end of World War Two. The unresolved clash over who has sovereignty over the chain - known in Russia as the Kuril Islands and in Japan as the Northern Territories - has prevented the two sides from signing a formal peace treaty. Japan - which joined other allies in imposing sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine invasion - marks a Northern Territories Day commemoration every Feb. 7 to remind people of its claim. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the event this year &quot;was marked by a particular intensity of Russophobia,&quot; citing statements by officials and what she called &quot;aggressive actions&quot; by far-right Japanese forces near Russian missions. Zakharova, reiterating Russia&#x27;s long-standing position that it has sovereignty over the islands, accused Japan of rewriting history and ignoring post-war realities.Japan&#x27;s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Japan  tightened its Russia sanctions last month in the wake of missile attacks on Ukraine, adding goods to an export ban list and freezing the assets of Russian officials and entities. This prompted Moscow to warn of an unspecified impact on its relationship with Japan. Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Caitlin Webber"

A still image taken from a video that apparently shows a flying object exploding in an intense burst of light near the dome of the Kremlin Senate building [Ostorozhno Novosti/Handout via Reuters] Published On 3 May 2023 3 May 2023 Updated :  4 May 2023 Russia has accused Ukraine of attempting an overnight drone attack on the Kremlin with the aim of killing President Vladimir Putin, the most dramatic charge Moscow has levelled against Kyiv since the  war on its neighbour began. The allegation was made on Wednesday by the Russian government and reported by several state news agencies. Putin was not in the building at the time and there was no material damage to the Kremlin, Russian officials said, as they warned of their right to retaliate. “The Kremlin has assessed these actions as a planned terrorist act and an assassination attempt on the president on the eve of Victory Day, the May 9 Parade,” state news outlet RIA reported, adding that Putin had not changed his schedule and was working at his Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow. Moscow has vowed the parade will go ahead, amid calls for a tough reaction against Ukraine. Ex-President Dmitry Medvedev called for the “elimination” of Zelenskyy. “We will demand the use of weapons capable of stopping and destroying the Kyiv terrorist regime,” said Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the Russian Duma and Putin ally. The Investigative Committee of Russia, which probes major crimes, said in a statement it had opened a “criminal case on terrorism.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denied the accusations, saying his country had not attacked Moscow or its president. “We don’t attack Putin, or Moscow; we fight on our territory,” Zelenskyy told a news conference in Helsinki, Finland. “We defend our villages and cities.” Senior Ukrainian presidential official Mykhailo Podolyak also told the Reuters news agency that Kyiv had nothing to do with the alleged incident. In a tweet, he suggested Russia’s claims were a false flag, saying, “Russia is clearly preparing a large-scale terrorist attack.” As for the drones over the Kremlin. It’s all predictable… Russia is clearly preparing a large-scale terrorist attack. That's why it first detains a large allegedly subversive group in Crimea. And then it demonstrates \"drones over the Kremlin\". First of all, Ukraine wages an… May 3, 2023 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken voiced doubt about the allegations. “I’ve seen the reports. I cannot validate them, we simply don’t know,” he said at an event in Washington, DC. “I would take anything coming out of the Kremlin with a very large shaker of salt.” Pavel Felgenhauer, a Russian defence analyst who served as a senior research officer in the Soviet Academy of Sciences, told Al Jazeera that if the Kremlin’s accusations were true, it would be difficult to “say which kind of drones were used”. “At nighttime, Putin doesn’t appear to be in the Kremlin. He goes there for working hours and doesn’t live there,” he added. Felgenhauer said that in retaliation, it was possible that Russia could order its forces in Ukraine to attack the presidential offices in central Kyiv. Volodin called for “destroying the Kyiv regime”, adding: “no negotiations can take place with the regime of Zelenskyy”. Video appears to show attempted attack Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Ukrainian minister of internal affairs, said Russian partisans were likely to have been behind the alleged attack. “Information appeared that the drone on the Kremlin was launched by Russian partisans from Moscow region,” he wrote on Twitter. The Kremlin did not present any evidence from the reported incident, and its statements included few details. An unverified video circulating on Russian social media showed pale smoke rising behind the main Kremlin Palace in the walled citadel after the purported incident. The video was posted in the early hours of Wednesday on a platform for residents of a neighbourhood that faces the Kremlin across the Moskva River. It was picked up by Russian media, including the Telegram channel of the military news outlet Zvezda. The alleged incident came as Ukrainian forces prepare for a counteroffensive they hope will liberate territory from Russian occupiers, more than a year after Putin ordered a full-scale invasion. Ukraine’s Zelenskyy is currently in Finland and plans to travel to Germany, as he calls for more military support from Kyiv’s Western allies. Sabotage attacks A recent series of apparent attacks in Russia have served as a reminder that the country is exposed to enemy blows. They have hit as Moscow gears up for the May 9 celebrations, when Russia marks the Soviet victory over the Nazis in what has become a central event for Putin’s rule. On Wednesday, dozens of firefighters were battling a huge fire that Russian authorities blamed on a Ukrainian drone crashing into an oil terminal on Russia’s side of the bridge it built to occupied Crimea. Meanwhile, an explosion caused a second freight train to derail in the Russian region of Bryansk bordering Ukraine. Russia also accused Ukraine of attacks in December on an air base deep inside Russian territory that houses strategic bomber planes equipped to carry nuclear weapons. In February, a drone crashed in Kolomna, about 110km (70 miles) from the centre of Moscow. Ukraine has typically declined to claim responsibility for attacks on Russia or Russian-annexed Crimea, but Kyiv officials have celebrated such assaults with cryptic or mocking remarks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the parade in Moscow was going ahead as expected with “no changes to the plans”, according to news agencies. Also on Wednesday, Moscow’s Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced a ban on unauthorised drone flights over the Russian capital. Sobyanin did not cite a reason for the ban, saying only that it would prevent the “illegal use of drones that can hinder the work of law enforcement”. A lawmaker who represents Crimea in Moscow, Mikhail Sheremet, told Russian state media that the Kremlin should order a missile attack on Zelenskyy’s residence in Kyiv in retaliation for Wednesday’s alleged incident."

      "Text": "How much money has the US given to Ukraine? Published 21 February Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image source,  Getty Images By Brandon Drenon BBC News, Washington DC US President Joe Biden announced nearly half a billion more dollars of US military aid to Ukraine during a surprise visit to Kyiv this week.  That&#x27;s on top of billions the US has already spent on Ukraine&#x27;s conflict with Russia. Congress appropriated more than $112bn (£92.47bn) in 2022 alone. The US is the largest contributor to Ukraine in terms of money spent. But a year into Russia&#x27;s invasion, some Americans are wondering where the money goes and if the aid is worth the cost. How much has the US given to Ukraine?  Before Mr Biden&#x27;s pledge in Ukraine this week, the US had committed nearly $80bn in aid to Ukraine. That&#x27;s according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, which  tracks global spending on aid to Ukraine Some $46.6bn of the US commitment is military aid,  far more money than any other country is donating . The UK comes second with $5.1bn in military aid, followed by the EU with $3.3bn.  That&#x27;s just military aid, however. Other kinds of aid add to the cost. Image caption,  Largest donors of military aid to Ukraine by country. Where does the money go? Military aid pays for drones, tanks, missiles and other munitions systems as well as training, logistics and intelligence support. Humanitarian and financial aid are extra. Humanitarian aid includes food assistance, safe drinking water, medical supplies and other necessities for Ukrainians displaced by the conflict. Financial aid is economic. It keeps Ukraine&#x27;s government operating by paying civil servants, healthcare workers and educators. Military aid accounts for more than half of the US spending on Ukraine, leaving $3.96bn committed to humanitarian aid and $26.73bn in financial aid. US diplomat on what it&#x27;s like negotiating with Putin Image caption,  The US has committed the most aid to Ukraine What are other nations spending on Ukraine? The US is not the biggest spender when commitments are ranked as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).  Estonia tops that chart with a pledge of 1.1% of its GDP, the Kiel Institute says. The US, on the other hand, is pledging just 0.4% of its GDP.  Although the US leads the global effort in providing aid to Ukraine dollar-for-dollar, it ranks fifth as a donor country by this scale. Image caption,  Largest donors of aid to Ukraine as percent of donor country GDP. How much money is that? Money continues to pour into the conflict from all over the world, with the US leading the way. Yet the price tag is still far lower than previous conflicts,  the Kiel Institute, a German research institute, notes"

      "Text": "Политолог: мятеж могли использовать, чтобы посеять недоверие в высших кругах власти Немецкие СМИ последние два дня много пишут о том, что Запад давно знал о готовящемся мятеже руководителя ЧВК \"Вагнер\" Евгения Пригожина. О его планах в подробностях знало ЦРУ еще за две недели до всех событий, но сведения были настолько секретные, что Вашингтон не мог поделиться ими на уровне разведок ни с кем в НАТО, кроме Великобритании. Значит ли это, что мятеж был инициирован извне? При чем здесь Лондон? Об этом в эфире программы  рассуждал политолог Александр Сосновский. Сосновский увидел параллель между названием ЧВК &quot;Вагнер&quot; и планом &quot;Валькирия&quot;. Это план германского сопротивления, известный также как заговор генералов. Он разрабатывался с 1942 года, результатом его стало неудачное покушение на нацистского лидера Адольфа Гитлера. То есть план предусматривал покушение на первое лицо государства с привлечением целой группы генералов, пояснил эксперт. По мнению политолога, такой план держало в голове руководство НАТО. Здесь возникают два вопроса: это попытка постфактум использовать мятеж Пригожина, чтобы посеять недоверие в высших кругах руководства России? Или это утечка информации, которая произошла не по воле тех, кто все это задумывал? Байден заявил о непричастности Запада к мятежу читайте также Сосновский полагает, что Пригожин без определенной поддержки не мог считать, что даже с 20-30 тысячами хорошо обученных бойцов он сможет что-то изменить, добиться изменения состава  генералитета России . У него &quot;были основания полагать, что его марш &ndash; это начало, это сигнал, на который должна была последовать какая-то реакция&quot;. Реакция, впрочем, была неожиданной:  ситуацию разрешили мирным путем при посредничестве президента Белоруссии Александра Лукашенко. Вечером 23 июня Пригожин обвинил ВС РФ в нанесении ударов по лагерям &quot;Вагнера&quot;. В Минобороны и ФСБ опровергли информацию о таких атаках, однако подразделения ЧВК вошли в Ростов-на-Дону и захватили штаб Южного военного округа, а затем двинулись к Москве. Президент РФ  Владимир Путин охарактеризовал происходящее как мятеж и предательство. В отношении Пригожина возбудили уголовное дело. В ходе переговоров при участии Лукашенко Пригожин согласился остановить свой &quot;марш&quot;, отправить бойцов обратно в полевые лагеря и уехать в Белоруссию. Дело в его отношении было закрыто, согласно обещанию Путина."

      "Text": "Запад не оставляет попыток перетянуть Казахстан на свою сторону 30.04.2023 |  МаратНУРГОЖАЕВ | 00.02 Версия для печати Политика Все-таки коллективный Запад слишком настырно взялся за Казахстан, отрабатывая именно на нем свои «новейшие» технологии ведения когнитивной войны (которую он, словно специально, «придумал» только в 2020 году), пытаясь расшатать обстановку в государстве до «кровавого января 2022 года». Еще не успели «помпезно» отгреметь в священный месяц Рамадан народные бунты, устроенные прозападными НПО по разным «проблемам», начиная от «тяжкой» жизни «недолюбленных» феминисток и отсутствия «воздуха» в стране и заканчивая увольнениями работников-нефтяников, как подконтрольные Вашингтону СМИ начали вбрасывать в информационное поле агрессивные призывы к участию в очередном беспределе. На этот раз при поддержке фонда «Сорос-Казахстан», «реанимированного» под громким названием «центральноазиатский аналитический центр CAPS Unlock», США решили раскрутить другие «тревожащие» их «проблемы» Астаны, но начали все с тех же бывших работников компании «БерАли Мангистау Company». И вот оппозиционные социальные сети  «запестрели» многочисленными сообщениями в виде информационных агитационных листовок о проведении очередных акций протеста повсеместно по всей стране 1 мая, то есть в праздник единства народа Казахстана. Формально основным лозунгом к первомайской сходке служит такой: «Поддержим Жанаозен». Дальше первым по списку: «выход из ОДКБ и ЕАЭС», ну а потом полный винегрет из странных «хотелок»: «списание всех потребительских кредитов, поднятие зарплат, пенсий и пособий в два раза». Из всего этого многообразия требований непонятно только одно: в чём же заключается взаимосвязь выхода из ОДКБ и ЕАЭС с социально-экономическим положением страны и уровнем жизни местного населения, а тем более&nbsp;с ситуацией, касающейся уволенных нефтяников. Тем более что сам лидер государства Касым-Жомарт Токаев неоднократно заявлял, что прошлый год стал плодотворным и значительно расширил возможности сотрудничества стран-участниц ЕАЭС и в целом&nbsp;СНГ. По  оценке казахстанского президента, наблюдаются «очень хорошие тенденции»: товарооборот Казахстана со странами СНГ за январь-октябрь вырос на 11%, достигнув почти 30 млрд долларов. Учитывая, что за аналогичный период 2021 года он составил 26,5 млрд долларов, рост составил около 5 млрд долларов. Отметим также, что товарооборот между странами ЕАЭС также  увеличился на 12,8%, несмотря на сложные геополитические условия. При этом до 75-80% расчетов были проведены в национальных валютах, что также является положительным трендом. Разумеется, позитивные заявления К.-Ж. Токаева и факты поступательного развития ЕАЭС, в котором одну из ведущих ролей играет Казахстан, никак не вписываются в американские планы по стравливанию Астаны с дружественными государствами постсоветского пространства, особенно с Москвой. Собственно, поэтому еще летом 2022 года в большинстве западных СМИ  начали пробрасывать мысль о том, что указание казахстанского президента по поводу создания благоприятных условий для релокации в Казахстан зарубежных компаний, ушедших из России, дано намеренно в противовес Кремлю. Между тем пресс-секретарь российского президента Дмитрий Песков  отметил , что «это совершенно нормально, когда страна пытается у себя создать хорошие условия для инвесторов. Второй вопрос, что из-за давления извне многие компании вынуждены принимать такие решения». Кстати, подобное перемещение уже увеличило приток прямых иностранных инвестиций в Казахстан в прошлом году на 28%, так что, по мнению ряда местных экономистов, вполне логично развитие в рамках ЕАЭС промышленной кооперации, поскольку наши страны выступают за снятие ограничений и барьеров, которые мешают общему развитию рынков. Кроме того, на фоне антироссийских санкций Казахстан не только сможет заработать па транзите товаров, но и нарастить необходимую инфраструктуру &ndash; железные дороги, порты, склады. Особенно  актуальн о&nbsp;для Астаны в рамках ЕАЭС и СНГ&nbsp;строительство трансъевразийских логистических коридоров «Восток-Запад», «Север-Юг». Безусловно, понимая, что ЕАЭС может развиваться и по другим направлениям, в том числе в сфере науки и образования, спорта, а также учитывая, что в рамках ЕАЭС предприняты активные попытки по созданию единого рынка газа, десанты американских и европейских чиновников, постоянно держа Казахстан в фокусе, продолжают наведываться в эту гостеприимную страну. Но направляются они в свои путешествия на столь дальние дистанции отнюдь не из благих побуждений или праздного интереса, а для оказания давления на местное правительство, чтобы побудить его отказаться от какого-либо взаимодействия с Россией. Так, 24-25 апреля специальный посланник ЕС по санкциям Дэвид О&#39;Салливан  совершил официальный визит в Казахстан, где в привычной агрессивной манере начал диктовать руководству страны, а по сути шантажировать, заставляя перестать помогать России «обходить» западные санкции. В прессу также  просочилась информация о том, что глава Еврокомиссии Урсула фон дер Ляйен скоро приедет в Астану, дабы «поспособствовать установлению сотрудничества между республикой и промышленными альянсами ЕС в финансовой и технологической областях». Или, как утверждают злые языки, едет евробарыня творить «демократию» в Казахстане со следующими забавными тезисами: «Западная и американская демократия &ndash; это эталон правильной государственности»; «Свобода слова &ndash; основная ценность западного общества». Еврочиновник также считает, что неотъемлемой частью традиций кочевого народа является не что-нибудь, а именно гомосексуализм. Ну и основной посыл, который она должна вложить в уши казахстанского народа, подняв его на очередную «цветную революцию»: «Сменяемость власти &ndash; залог стабильного развития среднеазиатского государства». Остаётся надеяться, что эту дамочку также «прокатят» в Астане, как сделали это во время ее недавнего официального визита в Китай, где фон дер Ляйен просто-напросто проигнорировали, воспринимая как безделушку, зачем-то сопровождающую президента Франции. Похоже, пора уже коллективному Востоку показать коллективному Западу, кто тут «в доме хозяин», не поддаваясь на его нелепые провокации."

Она находится в состоянии средней тяжести и в сознании. По предварительной информации, семья приехала из Белгородской области.Губернатор региона поручил связаться с родными девочки, добавив, что “власти окажут всю необходимую помощь”.На ЧП на Крымском мосту отреагировали в Совете Федерации Федерального собрания РФ.По его словам, вероятно, последует жесткий и справедливый ответ России, а киевская власть \"лишила себя права\" на него жаловаться.Киевский режим роет себе глубокую яму и должен это хорошо понимать, заявил глава комитета Совфеда по международным делам Григорий Карасин.Глава парламента Крыма Владимир Константинов призвал к возмездию за атаку на Крымский мост.Также в Совфеде РФ призвали отсечь Украину от Черного моря после атаки на Крымский мост.Глава крымского парламента Владимир Константинов заявил в эфире, что за организацией теракта на Крымском мосту стоит лично Владимир Зеленский, и призвал возбудить в отношении него уголовное дело за организацию террористической деятельности.В свою очередь разведка Украины издевательски прокомментировала ЧП на Крымском мосту.Агентство РБК-Украина указало, что атака на Крымский мост является спецоперацией службы безопасности и военно-морских сил Украины, для осуществления использовались надводные дроны.Служба безопасности Украины фактически признала причастность к организации атаки на Крымский мост, опубликовав переделанный фрагмент украинской народной песни: \"Соловей, родной брат, опять мост пошел \"поспать\".Депутат украинского парламента Алексей Гончарук назвал ЧП с гибелью двух человек и ранением ребенка на Крымском мосту \"победой Украины\" и призвал представить причастных к высшим госнаградам.А советник командования воздушных сил украинских войск Юрий Игнат назвал \"хорошими новостями\" для Украины теракт на Крымском мосту, в результате которого погибли два человека, а еще один пострадал.Советник главы офиса Владимира Зеленского Михаил Подоляк прокомментировал в Twitter теракт на Крымском мосту, назвав его \"незаконным сооружением\" и пригрозив \"недолговечностью\" таких сооружений.Дипломат подчеркнула, что США и Великобритания \"осуществляют руководство террористической огосударствленной структурой\".Советник и. о. главы ДНР Дениса Пушилина Ян Гагин уверен, что Украина нанесла удар по крымскому мосту НАТОвскими беспилотниками-брандерами, вероятнее всего, с использованием морского коридора, предназначенного для перевозки зерна.Мировой и собственный опыт показывает, что террористы понимают только язык силы, поэтому надо взрывать их собственные дома, написал зампредседателя Совбеза России Дмитрий Медведев в Telegram-канале.А пресс-секретарь президента РФ Дмитрий Песков заявил, что Москва знает о том, что киевский режим стоит за терактом на Крымском мосту и гибелью молодой семьи, отдает отчет в коварности режима. Говоря о возможной причастности Запада к теракту на Крымском мосту, он отметил, что в Кремле осведомлены о том, \"насколько глубока\" координация киевского режима с Вашингтоном и рядом европейских столиц, поэтому \"никаких иллюзий\" по этому поводу нет.По его словам, ответом на атаку на Крымский мост в конечной перспективе станет достижение всех целей спецоперации на Украине.МИД РФ решительно осудил террористическую атаку “против Крымского моста, который является сугубо гражданским объектом”, выразив надежду, что “международное сообщество даст надлежащую оценку преступлению Киева”.В ведомстве также напомнили, что \"попытки нарушить транспортное сообщение с Крымом и оторвать его от остальной части России являются заведомо невыполнимыми.”"

По данным ведомства, Москва отзывает гарантии безопасности судоходства, сворачивает морской гуманитарный коридор в северо-западной акватории Черного моря, говорится в сообщении. Может ли Россия возобновить зерновую сделку и на каких условиях? А также о том, как Москва ответит на теракт, который произошел на Крымском мосту в ночь на 17 июля? Подробнее об этом в программе \"Диалоги с Генри Сардаряном\" на радио Sputnik.*– Событие, которое предшествовало теракту на Крымском мосту, – саммит НАТО, во время которого руководство Украины впервые начало слышать, что поднадоело своим западным кураторам, и излишняя настойчивость и требовательность вызывает нотки раздражения. Потому что им нечего предъявить. За 100 миллиардов долларов, которые были предоставлены Украине, она сумела лишь потерять четыре региона. Украинское руководство нуждалось в такой мерзкой провокации.– Не знаю, есть ли кто-то в нашей стране, у кого выражение \"зерновая сделка\" не вызывало бы раздражения и злости. И вот сегодня прозвучало, что зерновой сделке конец. Причина понятна. Я думаю, что за прошедший год с момента заключения сделки столько раз Россия заявляла о том, что она работает только в одну сторону, и ультимативно, шантажируя нас, западные страны, в том числе, Турция и Украина, заявляли, что если эта сделка не будет заключена, то африканские страны останутся без зерна. Хотя, как наш президент указывал, ни Африка, ни Ближний Восток ни при чем. Это зерно оседает совсем в других местах, на Западе. Это, скорее, бизнес- интересы, не более того. audio/mpeg Реакция на теракт на Крымском мосту и Конвенция Монтрё Может ли Турция нарушить Конвенцию Монтрё после прекращения зерновой сделки? Как российские власти должны реагировать на теракты в отношении российской территории?Как Россия может отвечать на участие НАТО в военных действиях на территории Украины? Детальный разбор тем в программе \"Диалоги с Генри Сардаряном\" на радио Sputnik– (о том, может ли Турция нарушить Конвенцию Монтре? – ред.): может. Турция в нынешней обстановке, по всей видимости, может все. Потому что очень быстро из \"главного защитника\" мусульман она превратилась в проводника членства Швеции в НАТО. Несмотря на совершенно больные эти акции по сожжению священной для мусульман книги –Коран. Потому что за этот период времени она уже неоднократно делала такие заявления, которые оставляют мало сомнений в том, что этот разворот после выборов совершенно не случаен, так же, как и неслучайно отсутствие массовых акций протеста и осуждения их и разгонов со стороны турецкой полиции, которое могло бы случиться, но почему-то не случилось. Все эти вещи взаимосвязаны, поэтому, если дойдет до того, что будет необходимо, чтобы Турция эту Конвенцию нарушила, вряд ли сегодня есть механизмы, которые могут ее в этом остановить. audio/mpeg Повреждение Крымского моста не было главной целью организаторов атаки на этот объект, считает политолог Генри Сардарян. В эфире радио Sputnik он высказал мнение о том, зачем киевскому режиму понадобился очередной теракт.Два человека погибли в результате теракта на Крымском мосту, ребенок остался сиротой. \"Сегодня ночью террористический режим Киева совершил новое преступление – атаковал Крымский мост\", – написал по этому поводу глава Госсовета (парламента) Крыма Владимир Константинов в Telegram. Служба безопасности Украины фактически признала свою причастность к теракту.В эфире своей авторской программы на радио Sputnik доктор политических наук, декан факультета управления и политики МГИМО Генри Сардарян назвал циничной реакцию представителей киевского режима на событие, ставшее причиной гибели мирных людей.\"Ужасающие по своему лицемерию и цинизму комментарии звучат от организаторов этого теракта, то есть от руководства Украины. Советник главы офиса Владимира Зеленского Михаил Подоляк прокомментировал теракт на Крымском мосту: он назвал мост незаконным сооружением и пригрозил недолговечностью подобных объектов\", – сказал Генри Сардарян.Террористический акт на Крымском мосту нужен был киевскому режиму только для того, чтобы отвлечь внимание западных кураторов от собственных неудач на поле боя, считает политолог.\"Нужно понимать, для чего был организован этот теракт. Вносит ли он какие-то коррективы в ход СВО? Абсолютно нет. Является ли он настолько масштабным, имеются в виду масштабы разрушений моста, чтобы сказать, что они смогли навсегда или, по крайней мере, на годы лишить Россию сухопутной связи с Крымом? Тоже нет. А в чем же тогда причина? Давайте посмотрим на событие, которое предшествовало теракту. Это, конечно же, саммит НАТО, во время которого руководство Украины впервые начало слышать, что поднадоело своим западным кураторам. Почему? Потому что Украине нечего предъявить, &amp;lt;…&amp;gt; что за те средства, которые ей были предоставлены, она сумела потерять четыре региона – вот ее главный результат. Поэтому украинское руководство нуждалось в дешевой и мерзкой провокации…, чтобы был иной инфоповод\", – уверен Генри Сардарян."

      "Text": "How Polish wargame where it loses to Russia could become a self-fulfilling prophecy Scott Ritter Scott Ritter @RealScottRitter @ScottRitter Celebrations of 20th anniversary of joining NATO, at military range in Wesola near Warsaw, Poland March 10, 2019 © Agencja Gazeta/Slawomir Kaminski/REUTERS  By losing a simulated war of its own invention with Russia, the Polish military seeks to convince NATO of its vulnerability. This could lead to a build-up of military forces that triggers the very conflict the Poles just lost. Late last month the Polish military reportedly  conducted a war game simulating a general war between Poland and Russia. Dubbed &lsquo;Winter-20&rsquo;, the simulation involved several thousand Polish officers who oversaw the virtual war between the two nations, according to Polish website Interia. The war game incorporated all of the Polish military&rsquo;s newest weapons, including the F-35 fighter. When the simulation ended, after five days of &ldquo;conflict,&rdquo; the Polish Army had been totally defeated, its combat units suffering between 60 and 80 percent losses, and the Russian Army stood on the banks of the Vistula River, ready to occupy Warsaw. According to an article serves as a reminder that NATO&rsquo;s Eastern flank is weak and vulnerable to Russian aggression. There would be no repeat of the August 1920 &lsquo;Miracle on the Vistula&rsquo;, where the beleaguered Polish troops commanded by Jozef Pilsudski rallied to decisively defeat the advancing Red Army commanded by Mikhail Tukachevsky. Nor would a modern-day Russian attack on Poland replicate the events of September 1939, when Semyon Timoshenko&rsquo;s Red Army troops occupied eastern Poland while the Polish Army was busy trying to defend against a Nazi German invasion, or January-August 1944, when Georgy Zhukov&rsquo;s Soviet forces advanced to the outskirts of Poland. While the last two represented Russian victories, they &mdash; like the Battle for Warsaw in 1920 &mdash; are a matter of historical record, representing events based on reality. &lsquo;Winter-20&rsquo;, on the other hand, is derived from delusional fantasy, a bit of self-defeatist theater designed to reinforce the dual perception of Polish-NATO weakness and Russian strength. Also on rt.com NATO’s expanding role hides the reality of a US empire in decline The US can barely afford to maintain one heavy armored brigade in theater and is hard pressed to generate a second brigade capable of reinforcing the region by falling in on prepositioned stocks of equipment. Germany is incapable of generating a single armored brigade for service in the field, having had to cannibalize its garrison forces to make ready the single battalion-sized battlegroup it has deployed to the Baltics. The British Army is in a similar sad state, significantly reduced in size and, like Germany, unable to mobilize an armored brigade for deployment to Poland or the Baltics in a timely fashion. The same holds true for the French Army. As for the Polish Army, it lags in almost every category of combat power generation, despite expending billions of dollars in support of force modernization and enlargement. The Global Firepower (GFP) annual defense review for 2021 evaluates the military forces of 139 countries around the world, based on a multitude of factors as they relate to a prolonged offensive or defensive military campaign. Poland is ranked 23rd Read more Moscow says increased US military presence in Poland worsens security situation in Europe, warns NATO trying to ‘distort reality’ By way of comparison, France is ranked 7th , with an index of 0.1691, the British 8th , with an index of 0.1997, and the Germans 15th , with an index rating of 0.2519. Russia is ranked 2nd , with an index rating of 0.0791. Only the United States, with an index rating of 0.0718 , has a higher power index. But the bulk of the US military is based out of the continental United States, and would take months to deploy to Europe. Russia, on the other hand, is operating from interior lines of communication using forces that are trained and equipped to fight and sustain a large-scale ground conflict with minimal mobilization requirements. The question here is not about capability, but rather intent. The reconfiguration of the Russian Army away from brigade-sized formations designed to fight smaller conflicts, to the rebirth of Soviet-era formations such as the 1st Guards Tank Army and the 20th Combined Arms Army occurred not because Russia seeks the domination of Europe by military means, but rather necessitated by the eastward expansion of NATO to incorporate nations such as Poland and the Baltic States with hard-wired animosity toward Russia. One way may be to change our map sheets east of the Vistula. How do we reframe from COIN to LSCO? One way may be to change our map sheets. Focus east of the Vistula and north of the Han. That will focus you on LSCO. February 5, 2021 Although NATO may define its mission in this region as defensive in nature, the military maneuvers required to rush reinforcements to the Suwalki Gap are identical to those that would be carried out in the event NATO were to undertake offensive operations against either Kaliningrad or Belarus. For Russia, there is no differentiating between the two. This reality is omitted in the National Interest article, whose author postulates as fact the notion that Russia has vowed &ldquo;to use nuclear weapons to defend territory it conquers and controls.&rdquo; Russian nuclear doctrine makes no such assertion, and public statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin reaffirm Russia&rsquo;s official nuclear posture &mdash; massive retaliation in the event nuclear weapons are ever used against Russian territory. Also on rt.com US nukes in Poland would not be a deterrent, but a MASSIVE provocation for Russia For its part, NATO has taken the bait, pouring troops and material into the Polish-Baltic region in numbers that eventually will constitute a viable offensive military capability. When this evolving military situation is juxtaposed with NATO&rsquo;s aggressive posture regarding the internal domestic affairs of Belarus, and the possibility of Ukraine becoming a NATO member, the result is a military threat Russia cannot ignore."

      "Text": "Zelensky fires Ukrainian ambassador to the UK after ‘sarcasm’ comments By  Mick Krever ,  Sharon Braithwaite and  Christian Edwards , CNN Updated7:23 AM EDT, Fri July 21, 2023 Link Copied! Ad Feedback Ukraine's ambassador to the United Kingdom Vadym Prystaiko in Westminster, London, in 2022. Tom Nicholson/Reuters London CNN Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky fired his  ambassador to the United Kingdom on Friday. The ambassador, Vadym Prystaiko, had criticized Zelensky over his reaction to recent remarks by British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace, who had suggested Ukraine had not expressed sufficient “gratitude” for Western financial support. Prystaiko said Zelensky’s response to Wallace amounted to “unhealthy” sarcasm. A  statement published Friday on the Ukrainian presidency’s website confirmed Prystaiko’s dismissal but did not provide a reason. The tension began at a  NATO summit in Lithuania earlier this month, when Wallace said that “whether we like it or not, people want to see gratitude for the West’s military contributions to Ukraine’s war effort. “I said to the Ukrainians last June, when I drove 11 hours to be given a list – I’m not Amazon,” Wallace said. When asked about those remarks by a reporter at the NATO summit, Zelensky was nonplussed. “I just don’t know what he means. How else should we thank him? Well, let him write to me and tell me how I need to thank people so that we can be fully grateful. We can also wake up in the morning and thank the minister personally.” Zelensky and Prystaiko leave following an audience with King Charlies III at Buckingham Palace, February 8, 2023. Kirsty O'Connor/AFP/Getty Images Prystaiko was  interviewed about the exchange the following day on Sky News, where he was asked whether there was a “hint of sarcasm” in Zelensky’s response to Wallace. Prystaiko conceded there was “a little bit of sarcasm,” and went on to say: “I don’t believe this sarcasm is healthy.” “We don’t have to show the Russians that we have something between us. They have to know that we are working together. If anything happens, Ben can call me and tell me everything he wants,” said Prystaiko. CNN has attempted, unsuccessfully, to reach Prystaiko for comment."

Ukraine is alive and kicking.”  But alongside Zelensky’s gratitude was a plea, emphasizing that his armed forces are outnumbered and outgunned by the Russian military even as they fight on. At one point, Zelensky drew laughs from the chamber when he said, “We have artillery, yes. Thank you. We have it. Is it enough? Honestly, not really.” Zelensky’s visit to Washington marks his first trip outside his  homeland since it was invaded 300 days ago, arriving Wednesday afternoon to set a course for the future of the war alongside a key Western ally.  On “the frontline of tyranny,” Zelensky argued during his speech to Congress, American support “is crucial not just to stand in such (a) fight but to get to the turning point to win on the battlefield.” “The world is too interconnected and too interdependent to allow someone to stay aside and at the same time to feel safe when such a battle continues,” he added. “Our two nations are allies in this battle and next year will be a turning point, I know it – the point where Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values.”  “Your money is not charity,” he asserted to Congress. “It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.” Zelensky also called on lawmakers to strengthen sanctions against Russia.  Still, despite that disparity in resources, Zelensky said, “Ukraine holds its line and will never surrender.” In his speech, Zelensky harkened back to American history, referencing the Battle of the Bulge, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Battle of Saratoga. Just like “brave American soldiers which held their lines” and fought against Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Germany in 1944, Ukrainian soldiers “are doing the same to Putin’s forces this Christmas,” Zelensky said. He also briefly discussed a 10-point peace formula and summit that he told US President Joe Biden about during an earlier meeting at the White House. Zelensky claimed Biden supported the peace initiatives.  Zelensky also recalled his recent visit to the frontlines – Bakhmut in Donbas – which has been under siege since May. There, he said, “every inch of that land is soaked in blood, roaring guns sound every hour.” In the climatic moment of the speech, he unveiled a Ukrainian flag signed by soldiers fighting in Bakhmut that he gave as a gift to the Congress. “The occupiers have a significant advantage in artillery. They have an advantage in ammunition. They have much more missiles and planes than we ever have. It’s true, but our defense forces stand,” he added. Russia, Zelensky argued in strong terms, has “found an ally” in Iran.  “Iran’s deadly drones sent to Russia in hundreds became a threat to our critical infrastructure. That is how one terrorist has found the other,” he said. “It is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies if we do not stop them now.” Zelensky’s White House visit Earlier Wednesday the Ukrainian leader visited the White House, where he met with Biden and held a joint news conference, during which the duo displayed a united front on their approach to the war. “I think … we share the exact same vision, and that a free, independent, prosperous and secure Ukraine is the vision – we both want this war to end,” Biden told reporters in the White House East Room. At the start of the news conference, Biden relayed that he felt it was “particularly meaningful” to speak to Zelensky in person and “look each other in the eye.” The Ukrainian president’s leadership, Biden said, has inspired the world.  “We understand in our bones that Ukraine’s fight is part of something much bigger,” Biden continued.  Biden said Zelensky has shown his “strong stand against aggression in the face of the imperial appetites of autocrats,” and said the US was standing alongside Ukraine in maintaining “core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Both Biden and Zelensky addressed the Russians during the news conference, with the Ukranian president repeatedly calling Russian forces “terrorists” and Biden underscoring the importance of being “clear” about Russia’s actions.  “It is purposely attacking Ukraine critical infrastructure, destroying the system to provide heat and light (to) Ukrainian people during the coldest, darkest part of the year. Russia is using winter as a weapon, freezing people, starving people, cutting them off from one another,” Biden said. The war, Biden later argued, “could end today if Putin had any dignity at all and did the right thing and just … pulled out. But that’s not gonna happen.”  But the two leaders, it seems, still have different perspectives on their approach to pursuing peace with Russia.  Early in the news conference, Biden said Zelensky was open to pursuing a “just peace.” Later, when asked by a reporter to share his idea of a fair way to end the war, the Ukrainian leader responded, “For me, as a president, just peace is no compromises as to the sovereignty, freedom and territorial integrity of my country, the payback for all the damages inflicted by Russian aggression.”  “There can’t be any just peace in the war that was imposed on us by these … inhumans, I would say,” he added.

NA/Ukrainian Presidency In pictures: Zelensky&#x27;s wartime visit to US Prev Next Zelensky arrived to the South Lawn just after 2 p.m. ET, eschewing a suit for his now-familiar military green shirt. A military honor guard lined the White House driveway as his black vehicle pulled toward the building. “I understand that we have very important topics and we’ll discuss them, everything, so many challenges in Ukraine, in Europe, in the world, from energy to the situation on the battlefield,” Zelensky said in the Oval Office. “But first of all, really, all my appreciations from my heart, from the heart of Ukrainians, all Ukrainians, from our nation.” Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visits Ukrainian service members at their position in the frontline town of Bakhmut, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Donetsk region, Ukraine December 20, 2022. Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY. Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Reuters Analysis: Why Zelensky&#x27;s surprise US visit is so hugely significant The wartime visit was meant to demonstrate in stirring fashion the continued American commitment to Ukraine at a moment when Biden’s ability to maintain that support at home and abroad is being tested. It has also been an opportunity for Biden and top American officials to sound out Zelensky on how he views the trajectory of the conflict, and to offer their thoughts on what it would take to bring the war to an end. “Together with our partners, we’re also going to impose costs on the Kremlin and will support Ukraine in pursuing a just peace,” Biden said in the Oval Office, a reference to how Zelensky has said he hopes to see the war end. “President Zelensky, the United States stands with the brave people in Ukraine.” Sitting before a roaring fireplace, Zelensky offered Biden a military cross medal from a Ukrainian soldier serving on the front lines.  “He said, ‘Give it to a very brave president,’” Zelensky said. “Undeserved but much appreciated,” Biden replied as he accepted the medal, asking if it would be possible to contact the Ukrainian soldier. A surprise visit The trip, which US and Ukrainian officials arranged in secret over the past week, came with heavy risks. After arriving in Poland by train, Zelensky flew to Washington aboard an American military aircraft, US officials said. He arrived in the US shortly after midday at Joint Base Andrews, just outside the nation’s capital. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Biden first discussed the prospect of Zelensky visiting Washington during a telephone call with the Ukrainian leader on December 11, an administration official said. A formal invitation was extended a week ago that Zelensky accepted, launching joint consultations on the security parameters of the risky, highly secretive trip. Zelensky, who the official said was “very keen” to visit the US, determined those parameters met his needs, and the US set to work executing them. The trip was finally confirmed on Sunday.  Tight security was enforced around Zelensky’s visit amid concerns that Russia wants to incapacitate the Ukrainian president, a source close to the Ukrainian leader told CNN on Wednesday. Because of this ongoing threat, senior top government officials – as well as embassy staff in the US – were not informed about the schedule of the visit. According to the source, the military risk had to be calculated allowing the Ukrainian president to make the short overseas trip without jeopardizing the military situation. Scheduling also had to be worked with the White House to assess availability for this to happen. In weighing a visit, Zelensky suggested he did not want to travel had there not been a significant development in the bilateral relationship between Ukraine and the US. Zelensky viewed the US decision to send Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine as a major shift in the relationship between the two allies. The new, $1.8 billion package Biden unveiled includes a Patriot surface-to-air missile system, which has been a longstanding request of Ukraine’s to fend of Russian air attacks.  CNN was first to report the US was expected to send the Patriot systems to Ukraine. Unlike smaller air defense systems, Patriot missile batteries need much larger crews, requiring dozens of personnel to properly operate them. The training for Patriot missile batteries normally takes multiple months, a process the United States will now carry out under the pressure of near-daily aerial attacks from Russia. The system is widely considered one of the most capable long-range weapons to defend airspace against incoming ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as some aircraft. Because of its long-range and high-altitude capability, it can potentially shoot down Russian missiles and aircraft far from their intended targets inside Ukraine. During the news conference, Biden told CNN’s Phil Mattingly that the missile system is defensive, not escalatory. Zelensky said the system is “something that will strengthen our air defense significantly.” “Every dollar of this investment for the United States is going to be a strengthening of global security and I know that the American leadership will be strong and will play important role in global scope,” Zelensky added.  He also suggested Ukraine would want more of the systems."

      "Text": "Zelensky dominates summit as G7 leaders call out China Published 20 May Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image source,  Getty Images By Tessa Wong BBC News, Hiroshima Volodymyr Zelensky made a scene-stealing arrival at the G7 summit in Japan on Saturday, as world leaders issued a veiled warning to China. The Ukrainian president arrived in Hiroshima on a French government plane, after a stopover in Saudi Arabia. His hastily-organised visit prompted G7 leaders to issue a statement early, in which they condemned Russia. They also warned against &quot;economic coercion&quot;, which Beijing is accused of using against several countries. This year&#x27;s gathering of the world&#x27;s richest democracies saw them extending invitations to several emerging economies in the so-called Global South, as well as India and Australia. Top of the agenda is the Ukraine war, and Mr Zelensky&#x27;s last-minute appearance has added heft and urgency to discussions - as well as star power. He arrived hours after  Washington said it would train Ukrainian pilots on American-made F-16 fighter jets and allow allies to provide the advanced warplanes to Kyiv - a move condemned by Russia but hailed by Mr Zelensky as &quot;historic&quot;.  Crucial questions as US supports fighter jets to Ukraine For the previous 24 hours, a &quot;will he or won&#x27;t he&quot; drama over Mr Zelensky&#x27;s trip to Japan dominated the news cycle. News of his possible visit broke on Friday and stole the limelight, just as leaders visited a peace memorial park in Hiroshima. But even as news outlets scrambled to confirm it, there were confusing signals from Ukrainian officials on whether the Ukrainian leader was coming. It was a sign that, while his visit was reportedly mooted weeks ago in chats between Mr Zelensky and Japanese PM Fumio Kishida, the final decision was made abruptly. Even his exact arrival time was shrouded in secrecy, until Japanese TV stations suddenly flashed live footage of him arriving at Hiroshima airport on a plane loaned to him by his close ally French President Emmanuel Macron. Now that he is here, Mr Zelensky&#x27;s presence not only adds a zing to the placid diplomatic proceedings, it overshadows them. Zelensky accuses some Arab leaders of &#x27;blind eye&#x27; to war ahead of Japan trip G7 summit: Taiwan looms large as Japan prepares to host leaders But it is unlikely the G7 leaders will mind. Their sanctions so far have failed to stop Russia&#x27;s invasion, and Friday&#x27;s pledge to &quot;starve&quot; Russia of resources for its &quot;war machine&quot; remains vague. But with world leaders literally standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr Zelensky, the optics send a firm message to Moscow that they mean business. The leaders also sought to deliver a message to Moscow&#x27;s ally, China. Besides addressing key topics such as nuclear non-proliferation and climate change, their joint final statement talked about their commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, which they tried to demonstrate by inviting countries such as Indonesia, India and the Cook Islands. They stressed their support of South East Asian and Pacific countries, which have been heavily wooed by Beijing, and called for a &quot;free and open Indo-Pacific&quot; - rhetoric used in the past in response to China&#x27;s territorial claims in the South China Sea. Stressing their commitment to &quot;economic resilience&quot;, they vowed to take steps to &quot;reduce excessive dependences in our critical supply chains&quot; - a reference to how the G7 countries are still inextricably linked to China in trade. China on Saturday expressed &quot;strong dissatisfaction&quot; with the G7&#x27;s joint statement, and complained to the summit organiser Japan, Beijing&#x27;s foreign ministry said. The summit will close on Sunday with Mr Zelensky, US President Joe Biden and Mr Kishida expected to speak."

      "Text": "Any Russian victory could be perilous Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is raising the stakes in the battle for Bakhmut, warning that Russia would use a much-needed victory on the war’s front lines to start building international support for a deal that would require Ukrainian compromises. By&nbsp;JULIE PACE and HANNA ARHIROVA Published [hour]:[minute] [AMPM] [timezone], [monthFull] [day], [year] Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Flipboard Print ON A TRAIN FROM SUMY TO KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned Tuesday that unless his nation wins a drawn-out battle in a key eastern city, Russia could begin building international support for a deal that could require Ukraine to make unacceptable compromises. He also invited the leader of China, long aligned with Russia, to visit. If  Bakhmut fell to Russian forces , their president, Vladimir Putin, would “sell this victory to the West, to his society, to China, to Iran,” Zelenskyy said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. “If he will feel some blood — smell that we are weak — he will push, push, push,” Zelenskyy said in English, which he used for virtually all of the interview.  The leader spoke to the AP aboard a train shuttling him across Ukraine, to cities near some of the fiercest fighting and others where his country’s forces have successfully repelled Russia’s invasion. Zelenskyy rarely travels with journalists, and the president’s office said AP’s two-night train trip with him was the most extensive  since the war began Since then, Ukraine — backed by much of the West — has surprised the world with the strength of its resistance against the larger, better-equipped Russian military. Ukrainian forces have  held their capital, Kyiv , and pushed Russia back from other strategically important areas.  But as the war enters its second year, Zelenskyy finds himself focused on keeping motivation high in both his military and the general Ukrainian population — particularly the millions who have fled abroad and those living in relative comfort and security far from the front lines. Zelenskyy is also well aware that his country’s success has been in great part due to waves of international military support, particularly from the United States and Western Europe. But some in the United States — including Republican Donald Trump, the former American president and current 2024 candidate — have questioned whether Washington should continue to supply Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid.  Trump’s likely Republican rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, also suggested that defending Ukraine in a “territorial dispute” with Russia was not a significant U.S. national security priority. He later  walked that statement back after facing criticism from other corners of the GOP.  Zelenskyy didn’t mention the names of Trump or any other Republican politicians — figures he might have to deal with if they prevailed in 2024 elections. But he did say that he worries the war could be impacted by shifting political forces in Washington.  “The United States really understands that if they stop helping us, we will not win,” he said in the interview. He sipped tea as he sat on a narrow bed in the cramped, unadorned sleeper cabin on a state railway train. The president’s carefully calibrated railroad trip was a remarkable journey across land through a country at war. Zelenskyy, who has become a recognizable face across the world as he doggedly tells his side of the story to nation after nation, used the morale-building journey to carry his considerable clout to regions close to the front lines. He traveled with a small cadre of advisers and a large group of heavily armed security officials dressed in battlefield fatigues. His destinations included ceremonies marking the one-year anniversary of the liberation of towns in the Sumy region and visits with troops stationed at front-line positions near Zaporizhzhia. Each visit was kept under wraps until after he departed.  Zelenskyy recently made a similar visit  near Bakhmut , where Ukrainian and Russian forces have been locked for months in a grinding and bloody battle. While some Western military analysts have suggested that the city is not of significant strategic importance, Zelenskyy warned that a loss anywhere at this stage in the war could put Ukraine’s hard-fought momentum at risk. “We can’t lose the steps because the war is a pie — pieces of victories. Small victories, small steps,” he said.  Zelensky’s comments were an acknowledgement that losing the 7-month-long battle for Bakhmut — the longest of the war thus far — would be more of a costly political defeat than a tactical one. He predicted that the pressure from a defeat in Bakhmut would come quickly — both from the international community and within his own country. “Our society will feel tired,” he said. “Our society will push me to have compromise with them.” So far, Zelenskyy says he hasn’t felt that pressure. The international community has largely rallied around Ukraine following Russia’s Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. In recent months, a parade of world leaders have visited Zelenskyy in Ukraine, most traveling in on trains similar to the ones the president uses to crisscross the country. In his AP interview, Zelenskyy extended an invitation to Ukraine to one notable and strategically important leader who has not made the journey — Chinese President Xi Jinping.  “We are ready to see him here,” he said. “I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have.” China, economically aligned and politically favorable toward Russia across many decades, has provided Putin diplomatic cover by staking out an official position of neutrality in the war. Asked whether Xi would accept an invitation from Zelenskyy — or whether one had been officially extended — Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters she had no information to give. She did say that Beijing maintains “communication with all parties concerned, including Ukraine.” d22878b020ad4375bb2a03e1b10bfdd5 Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked whether a meeting between Xi and Zelenskyy would be useful to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, said Russian authorities “highly appreciate” China’s balanced position on the issue and “have no right to come up with any advice” on whether the two should meet. “The Chinese leader himself decides the appropriateness of certain contacts,” Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters Wednesday. Xi visited Putin in Russia last week , raising the prospect that Beijing might be ready to provide Moscow with the weapons and ammunition it needs to refill its depleted stockpile. But Xi’s trip ended without any such announcement. Days later, Putin announced that he would be deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which neighbors Russia and pushes the Kremlin’s nuclear stockpile closer to NATO territory.  Zelenskyy suggested Putin’s move was intended to distract from the lack of guarantees he received from China.  “What does it mean? It means that the visit was not good for Russia,” Zelenskyy speculated. He was unsparing in his assessment of Putin, calling him an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian president makes few predictions about the biggest question hanging over the war: how it will end. He expressed confidence, however, that his nation will prevail through a series of “small victories” and “small steps” against a “very big country, big enemy, big army” — but an army, he said, with “small hearts.” And Ukraine itself? While Zelenskyy acknowledged that the war has “changed us,” he said that in the end, it has made his society stronger.  “It could’ve gone one way, to divide the country, or another way — to unite us,” he said. “I’m so thankful. I’m thankful to everybody — every single partner, our people, thank God, everybody — that we found this way in this critical moment for the nation. Finding this way was the thing that saved our nation, and we saved our land. We are together.”"

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight As Russia celebrated its most emotional holiday commemorating the Nazi defeat in World War II, Putin appeared in Moscow’s Red Square to invoke pride over the Soviet role in that cause and cast the invasion of Ukraine as a comparable effort. “There is no place in the world for executioners, punishers and Nazis,” he said. Putin’s speech was brief and made no mention of  Russian troops’ poor performance and miscalculations.  And he did not declare the “special military operation” to be a “war” or announce a general or partial mobilization to rebuild depleted Russian forces, as some had feared. Advertisement Instead, Victory Day was observed in a more somber and subdued way in Red Square and across parts of Ukraine. The governor of Kharkiv — Ukraine’s second-most-populous city, where Ukrainian troops have been pushing back Russian battalions — said there was less shelling Monday than any day since the conflict began 75 days ago. In Kherson, Ukrainian forces  launched a counteroffensive against Russians occupying the area, a Russian news agency reported. Four missiles, believed fired from Russian-occupied Crimea, struck areas near the port city of Odessa. And rescue efforts remained on hold in the village of Bilohorivka in Luhansk, one day after  an airstrike on a school buried dozens of civilians, including children, under rubble Russia's ultimate political survivor faces a wartime reckoning In Washington, President Biden  signed into law a bill that will expedite the process of sending military aid to Ukraine. White House press secretary Jen Psaki accused Putin — who in his speech also claimed without evidence that Kyiv was planning to build nuclear weapons — of “perverting history.” A senior U.S. defense official said intelligence reports indicate that some middle-rank Russian military officers in Ukraine are disobeying their commanders, while others are not acting with the “alacrity” that would be expected. Russian forces have continued to struggle in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region in the face of stiff resistance, said the senior official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon. While the Kremlin has continued to slowly insert additional military units into eastern Ukraine, Russian forces south of the town of Izyum have advanced a “single-digit” number of kilometers, the official said. The Pentagon has seen no sign of Moscow trying to mobilize additional forces inside Russia that are not already focused on Ukraine. Advertisement Russia’s retreat from areas around Kyiv more than a month ago, and Kharkiv more recently, has given many Ukrainians reason for hope , even as Russia consolidates control over large parts of the eastern and southern regions of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson. In Kharkiv on Monday, restaurants were open, though their backdrop was a downtown where most businesses are damaged from more than two months of near-constant shelling. “This day is even more symbolic for us because we’re expecting our own victory — and not just the victory of our ancestors,” regional governor Oleh Synyehubov said. Ahead of Victory Day pageantry, destruction and visits by dignitaries In Moscow, Putin arrived at Red Square shortly before 10 a.m. On his black coat he wore a Saint George’s ribbon of black and orange — denoting victory over fascism. His silhouette was notably bulked out, raising speculation that he was wearing a flak jacket, and he shook hands with some of the hundreds of elderly World War II veterans who were in the square. Advertisement In a 10-minute speech, Putin encouraged the 11,000 service personnel in attendance and described Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “preemptive response” to NATO actions, which he described as aggression and fueling false histories of prior wars. He offered no details on any of his claims but railed at the United States and European  countries for their roles before and during the war with Ukraine. Putin said Russia tried to have an honest dialogue on European security, but “the NATO countries did not want to hear us, which means that, in fact, they had completely different plans. And we saw it.” He accused the NATO alliance of preparing a “punitive operation” to invade Russia’s “historical lands,” including Crimea,  which Russia annexed in 2014 The parade began with eight goose-stepping soldiers in dress uniform bearing the Russian flag and red Soviet-era victory banner. As triumphal military music rose, Defense Minister  Sergei Shoigu stood in an open-topped convertible and saluted and congratulated military formations, filled with dozens of smiling personnel. Dozens of parades and other events were held across Russia on Sunday and Monday, all decked out with the letter Z, which has become  a symbol of the invasion , emblazoned on Russian armored vehicles as they have rumbled across Ukraine. On Monday, Russian children turned out for parades, riding model tanks and airplanes marked with Z. People posed in Z formations for videos and photos. Advertisement In Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine, authorities in Donetsk and Luhansk staged ceremonies lighting eternal flames in honor of World War II’s dead and those killed in the current war, but ruled out parades of their own. State television broadcast footage of Russian soldiers handing out Soviet flags with the Saint George’s ribbon in villages near Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine. Hundreds of videos expose the horrors of war in Ukraine In the ravaged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, separatist leaders, including militant Denis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk People’s Republic, unfurled a 984-foot banner of the Saint George’s ribbon. The once-thriving city has been nearly razed during weeks of Russian bomb and artillery attacks. Pro-Russian figures carried the banner amid its ruins. Near the front lines in the Donetsk region, relative calm prevailed — at least through the morning hours. Few Ukrainian cities sounded their air-raid sirens overnight. In the town of Lyman, where fighting has raged in recent weeks, civilians used the relative quiet to make frantic dashes to the armored evacuation buses organized by the regional government. Advertisement “We waited weeks for this,” said 70-year-old Volodymyr Yutin. He was evacuated to a hospital in the Donbas region with his 94-year-old mother, Katerina, her small frame wrapped in a blanket on a stretcher. But their escape brought them little joy. They had not heard from Yutin’s daughter, Daria, since April 24. “Her husband’s last text message said that they were in a basement, and they had food,” Yutin said. He turned away for a moment as his eyes filled with tears. “I hope they’re alive.” As the day wore on, fighting flared again. On the road between Kramatorsk and Lyman, reporters saw thick plumes of smoke, and rescue workers said it was getting harder to enter the town. Russian ambassador doused with red paint by protesters in Poland Among the casualties were Ukrainians of Russian origin who had stayed put in their homes because they didn’t think Moscow’s forces would harm them. Advertisement Lying anguished in a Donbas hospital bed, Ludmila Krivanos, 67, said she had ignored her children’s pleas to flee, telling them she could carry on with her normal life when the shelling died down. On Monday morning, she was thrown across her kitchen by a blast. When she heard her husband, Nikolai, screaming for help, she found that her legs would not move from underneath her. “I crawled to him and all I could see was blood,” she said. “We are Russians, we speak Russian. We never thought the Russians could do something like that to us.” Kharkiv is also a mostly Russian-speaking area. In a nearby town, Nikolai Manailo, a 99-year-old World War II veteran, opened a bottle of champagne for Victory Day. A native of Kharkiv, he once fought alongside Russians. “Who could’ve believed this could happen?” Manailo said quietly. He wished the two countries could just sit down at a table and sort out their differences over booze. Advertisement Ukraine was devastated by World War II. Kharkiv was occupied by the Nazis for more than two years. In his Victory Day address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said 8 million Ukrainians perished in the war — about 20 percent of the population at the time. Zelensky likened Putin to Adolf Hitler, saying the Russian leader was “following Nazi philosophy, copying everything they did.” He predicted Ukraine would prevail in the current conflict. “Very soon there will be two Victory Days in Ukraine,” he said. “And someone will not have even one left.”"

      "Text": "Ukraine war: President Putin speech fact-checked Published 21 February Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Russia-Ukraine war Image source,  EPA Image caption,  Vladimir Putin was delivering a state-of-the-nation speech to Russians By Reality Check team BBC News President Vladimir Putin addressed the Russian public in a national address which lasted for almost two hours. In the speech, he made a series of claims about the war in Ukraine and was highly critical of Western countries.  We&#x27;ve looked into some of his statements.  Mr Putin has repeatedly made baseless claims about a &quot;neo-Nazi regime&quot; in Ukraine as a justification for Russia&#x27;s invasion of the country.  In Ukraine&#x27;s last parliamentary election in 2019, support for far-right candidates was 2%, far lower than in many other European countries. It should also be noted that President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish and members of his family died in the Holocaust. But there have been far-right groups in Ukraine - the most high-profile is the Azov regiment - elements of which have expressed support for Nazi ideology.

Putin’s false Nazi claims about Ukraine It was formed to resist Russian-backed separatists, who seized areas of eastern Ukraine in 2014, and was subsequently absorbed as a unit within the Ukrainian military. Here, Mr Putin drew a comparison between a Ukrainian army unit and the Nazis&#x27; 1st Mountain Division - which had the Edelweiss flower on its insignia and committed war crimes in the Second World War.  On 14 February, President Zelensky  gave the  10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade the honorary title: Edelweiss.  The next day, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs highlighted this as &quot;evidence&quot; of Nazis in Ukraine in a tweet.  But the Edelweiss flower - which grows in Alpine regions - has been used as a symbol by other European mountain military divisions, including the  Croatian Mountain Rescue Service , Swiss Army generals and the 21st Rifles Brigade of Poland.  Even Russia had a special unit called Edelweiss. The 17th special purpose detachment of Rosgvardia was given this title in 2011. The name was changed to  Avanguard in 2016. There is no evidence that Ukraine has attempted to acquire nuclear weapons, and Mr Putin - who has made this claim before - did not provide any.  When it was part of the former Soviet Union, nuclear weapons were based in Ukraine, but in 1994 Ukraine signed up to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and gave them up, in return for security guarantees.  In 2021, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, suggested that if Ukraine couldn&#x27;t join Nato, it might have to reconsider its nuclear-free status. In 2022,  President Zelensky said that although Ukraine had &quot;abandoned&quot; its nuclear capabilities, it had &quot;no security&quot;.  But the Ukrainian government has not expressed an intention to acquire nuclear weapons and a military strategy document published in 2021 did not refer to them. Putin&#x27;s Ukraine statement fact-checked Putin&#x27;s Victory Day speech fact-checked Fact-checking Russia&#x27;s biological weapons claims Mr Putin is right that the Russian economy has shrunk by less than expected.

      "Text": "Russia says Israel supports Ukraine ‘neo-Nazis’ as row escalates Russian foreign ministry says Israel supports ‘neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv’, escalating a diplomatic dispute. The row began when Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Adolf Hitler had Jewish origins [File: Yuri Kochetkov/Pool via AP Photo] Published On 3 May 2022 3 May 2022 Russia’s foreign ministry has accused Israel of supporting neo-Nazis in Ukraine, escalating a row that began when Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Adolf Hitler had Jewish origins. Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said on Monday that Lavrov’s comment was an  “unforgivable” falsehood that tried to minimise the horrors of the Holocaust – the slaughter of six million European Jews and other minority groups by Nazi Germany. Leaders from several Western nations denounced Lavrov, who had been asked how Russia could be pursuing its stated goal of “de-nazifying” Ukraine when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself is a Jew. Zelenskyy, whose country is a parliamentary democracy, accused Russia of having forgotten the lessons of World War II. The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that Lapid’s comments were “anti-historical” and “explain to a large extent why the current Israeli government supports the neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv”. Moscow reiterated Lavrov’s point that Zelenskyy’s Jewish origins did not preclude Ukraine from being run by neo-Nazis. “Antisemitism in everyday life and in politics is not stopped and is on the contrary nurtured [in Ukraine],” it said in a statement. Israel has expressed support for Ukraine following the  Russian invasion in February . But wary of damaging relations with Russia, a power broker in neighbouring Syria, it initially avoided direct criticism of Moscow and has not enforced formal sanctions on Russian oligarchs. In the same light, Israel sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine and expressed support for its people, but the government did not join international sanctions against Russia. That paved the way for Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to be able to try to mediate between the sides, an effort which appears to have stalled as Israel deals with its own internal unrest. However, ties have grown more strained, with Lapid last month accusing Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine. “After the Kremlin claimed that Israel supports Nazism, I have just one question. Is there any non-Nazi country in the whole world in Russia’s point of view? Except Syria, Belarus and Eritrea, of course,” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted on Tuesday, mentioning countries that have supported what Moscow calls its “special operation” in Ukraine. In a speech at the end of March to the Israeli parliament, Zelenskyy called on Israel to “make a choice” by supporting Ukraine against Russia, and asked the Jewish state to provide it with weapons. Nazism has featured prominently in Russia’s war aims and narrative as it fights in Ukraine. In his bid to legitimise the war to Russian citizens, President Vladimir Putin has portrayed the battle as a struggle against Nazis in Ukraine, even though the country has a democratically elected government and a Jewish president whose relatives were killed in the Holocaust. Putin referenced the presence of units such as the Azov battalion within the Ukrainian military as one of the reasons for launching his so-called “special military operation”. Azov is a far-right all-volunteer infantry military unit founded in 2014 to fight pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Its early members were ultranationalists and were accused of harbouring neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideology. The unit has since been incorporated into the National Guard of Ukraine."

Ukrainian veterans of the Azov Battalion, formed by a white supremacist and banned from receiving U.S. aid, attend a rally in Kyiv on March 14, 2020. Vladimir Sindeyeve / NurPhoto via Getty Images March 5, 2022, 10:38 AM UTC By  Allan Ripp Of the many distortions manufactured by Russian President Vladimir Putin to justify  Russia’s assault on Ukraine , perhaps the most bizarre is his claim that the action was taken to “denazify” the country and its leadership. In making his case for entering his neighbor’s territory with armored tanks and fighter jets,  Putin has stated that the move was undertaken “to protect people” who have been “subjected to bullying and genocide,” and that Russia “will strive for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.” Putin’s destructive actions — among them the devastation of Jewish communities — make clear that he’s lying when he says his goal is to ensure anyone’s welfare. On its face, Putin’s smear is absurd, not least because Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish and has said that members of his family were  killed during World War II . There is also no evidence of recent mass killings or ethnic purges taking place in Ukraine. Moreover, labeling enemies Nazis is a common political ploy in Russia , especially from a leader who favors disinformation campaigns and wants to stir up feelings of national vengeance against a WWII foe to justify conquest. But even though Putin is engaging in propaganda, it’s also true that Ukraine has a genuine Nazi problem — both past and present. Putin’s destructive actions — among them the  devastation of Jewish communities — make clear that he’s lying when he says his goal is to ensure anyone’s welfare. But important as it is to defend the yellow-and-blue flag against the Kremlin’s brutal aggression, it would be a dangerous oversight to deny Ukraine’s antisemitic history and collaboration with Hitler’s Nazis, as well as the latter-day embrace of neo-Nazi factions in some quarters. Related Opinion Opinion Why are fleeing Ukrainians being talked about with such sympathy? They are white. On the eve of World War II, Ukraine was home to one the  largest Jewish communities in Europe , with estimates as high as  2.7 million , a remarkable number considering the territory’s long record of  antisemitism and  pogroms . By the end, more than half would perish. When German troops took control of Kyiv in 1941, they were welcomed by  “Heil Hitler” banners . Soon after, nearly 34,000 Jews — along with Roma and other “undesirables” — were rounded up and marched to fields outside the city on the pretext of resettlement only to be massacred in what became known as the “Holocaust by bullets.” The Babyn Yar ravine continued to fill up as a mass grave for two years. With as many as  100,000 murdered there , it became one of the largest single killing sites of the Holocaust outside of Auschwitz and other death camps. Researchers have noted the key role locals played in fulfilling Nazi kill orders at the site. Who is President Zelenskyy Feb. 28, 2022 01:43 Nowadays,  Ukraine counts between 56,000 to 140,000 Jews, who enjoy freedoms and protections never imagined by their grandparents. That includes an updated law passed last month  criminalizing antisemitic acts . Unfortunately, the law was intended to address a pronounced uptick in public displays of bigotry, including  swastika-laden vandalism of synagogues and Jewish memorials, and  eerie marches in Kyiv and other cities that  celebrated the Waffen SS In another ominous development, Ukraine has in recent years erected a glut of statues honoring Ukrainian nationalists whose legacies are tainted by their indisputable record as Nazi proxies. The Forward newspaper  cataloged some of these deplorables, including  Stepan Bandera , leader of the  , whose followers acted as local militia members for the SS and German army. “Ukraine has several dozen monuments and scores of street names glorifying this Nazi collaborator, enough to require two separate  Wikipedia  pages ,” the Forward wrote. Related Opinion Opinion We want to hear what you THINK. Please submit a letter to the editor. Another frequent honoree is Roman Shukhevych , revered as a Ukrainian freedom fighter but also the leader of a feared Nazi auxiliary police unit that the Forward notes was “responsible for butchering thousands of Jews and … Poles.” Statues have also been raised for  Yaroslav Stetsko , a one-time chair of the OUN, who wrote “I insist on the extermination of the Jews in Ukraine.” Far-right groups have also gained political currency in the past decade, none more chilling than  Svoboda Muscovite-Jewish mafia ” and whose deputy used an antisemitic slur to describe Ukrainian-born Jewish actor Mila Kunis. Svoboda has sent several members to Ukraine’s Parliament, including one who called the Holocaust a “ bright period ” in human history, according to Foreign Policy. Just as disturbing,  neo-Nazis are part of some of Ukraine’s growing ranks of volunteer battalions. They are battle-hardened after waging some of the toughest street fighting against Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine following Putin’s Crimean invasion in 2014. One is the  Azov Battalion , founded by an avowed white supremacist who claimed Ukraine’s  national purpose was to rid the country of Jews and other inferior races. In 2018, the U.S. Congress stipulated that its  aid to Ukraine couldn’t be used “to provide arms, training or other assistance to the Azov Battalion.” Even so, Azov is now an  official member of the Ukraine National Guard. For sure, none of this disturbing context justifies the misery that has befallen Ukrainians over the past several weeks — and it’s unlikely that Putin was motivated by any of it when he launched his invasion. Indeed, thanks to Putin, Jews living in Odessa, Kharkiv and other eastern cities are under  extreme duress . While many have taken refuge in local synagogues and Jewish centers, others have fled to foreign countries, including Israel, which has urged all  Jews to leave Ukraine Related Opinion Opinion How Putin&#x27;s imperialist blind spot could come back to haunt him My own grandparents themselves had to flee western Ukraine to escape persecution, and it is tragic to see this cycle continue. If the country devolves into chaos and insurgency, Jews could once again be at risk from some of their fellow citizens. Not acknowledging this threat means that little is being done to guard against it. But even if some elements of the country have been entangled with one of history’s most loathsome movements, standing with Ukraine is without doubt the honorable posture to take in this drama. Right now, every day that Putin ratchets up his assault against the Ukrainian people with scorched-earth zeal, it’s hard not to see who truly deserves the N-word."

Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin invoked World War II to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying in televised remarks last week that his offensive aimed to \"denazify\" the country — whose democratically elected president is Jewish, and lost relatives in the Holocaust.  \"The purpose of this operation is to protect people who for eight years now have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime,\" he said, according to an  English translation from the Russian Mission in Geneva. \"To this end, we will seek to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.\"  Europe  Russia bombards a Kyiv TV tower and the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial site  Russian officials have continued to employ that rhetoric in recent days.  Russia's Foreign Ministry  last week accused Western countries of ignoring what it called war crimes in Ukraine, saying their silence \"encouraged the onset of neo-Nazism and Russophobia.\" Russia's envoy to the United Nations reiterated  over the weekend that it is carrying out \"a special military operation against nationalists to protect the people of Donbass, ensure denazification and demilitarisation.\"  And Putin  has accused \"Banderites and neo-Nazis\" of putting up heavy weapons and using human shields in Ukrainian cities. Banderites is a term used — often pejoratively — to describe followers of controversial Ukrainian nationalist leader  Stepan Bandera , and Ukrainian nationalists in general.  World  Russia's at war with Ukraine. Here's how we got here The Russian invasion, and the language of \"denazification\" as a perceived pretext for it, quickly drew backlash from many world leaders, onlookers and experts alike. Criticisms of Russia's perceived hypocrisy  grew even louder on Tuesday, when  Russian strikes hit a memorial  to Babyn Yar — the site where Nazis killed tens of thousands of Jews during World War II.  Ukraine's official Twitter account  posted a cartoon of Putin and Adolf Hitler gazing lovingly into each others' eyes, writing that \"This is not a 'meme,' but our and your reality right now.\" The  U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum , among others, said Putin \"misrepresented and misappropriated Holocaust history.\"  A lengthy list of historians  signed a letter condemning the Russian government's \"cynical abuse of the term genocide, the memory of World War II and the Holocaust, and the equation of the Ukrainian state with the Nazi regime to justify its unprovoked aggression.\"  They pointed to a broader pattern of Russian propaganda frequently painting Ukraine's elected leaders as \"Nazis and fascists oppressing the local ethnic Russian population, which it claims needs to be liberated.\" And while Ukraine has right-wing extremists, they add, that does not justify Russia's aggression and mischaracterization.

It's a harmful distortion and dilution of history, they say, even though many people appear not to be buying it this time around.  Laura Jockusch, a professor of Holocaust studies at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, told NPR over email that Putin's claims about the Ukrainian army allegedly perpetrating a genocide against Russians in the Donbas region are completely unfounded, but politically useful to him.  \"Putin has been repeating this 'genocide' myth for several years and nobody in the West seems to have listened until now,\" she says. \"There is no 'genocide,' not even an 'ethnic cleansing' perpetrated by the Ukraine against ethnic Russians and Russian-speakers in the Ukraine. It is a fiction that is used by Putin to justify his war of aggression on the Ukraine.\"  She adds that his use of the word \"denazification\" is also \"a reminder that the term 'Nazi' has become a generic term for 'absolute evil' that is completely disconnected from its original historical meaning and context.\" Enlarge this image Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivers a speech next to a menorah at The Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv on Aug. 19, 2019.

Sergei Supinsky/AFP via Getty Images The baseless claims are part of a broader pattern The scholars characterize Putin's claims about genocide and Nazism as part of a long-running attempt to delegitimize Ukraine.  The Soviet Union used similar language — like calling pro-Western Ukrainians \"Banderites\" — to discredit Ukrainian nationalism as Nazism, explains José Casanova, a professor emeritus of sociology at Georgetown University and senior fellow at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs.  \"And now we see [Russia is] doing it every time the Ukrainians try to establish a democratic society, they try to say that those are Nazis,\" he says. \"You need to dehumanize the other before you are going to murder them, and this is what's happening now.\"  Olga Lautman, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis and co-host of the Kremlin File podcast, says Russia amped up the Nazi narrative after seizing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine invasion — explained  How an actor-turned-president found himself leading Ukraine during war Ukraine is home to ultranationalist movements, including most prominently the Azov Battalion, which formed in 2014 and later joined the country's National Guard after fighting against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. But Lautman estimates nationalists make up about 2% of Ukraine's population, with the vast majority having very little interest in anything to do with them.  She said the U.S. probably has a higher percentage of white supremacist and Nazi groups, while Casanova also says Ukraine has a smaller contingency of right-wing groups than other Western countries.  They also note that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish, as is the former prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman. Zelenskyy was elected in 2019 with a whopping 73% of the vote — a considerably larger share than his predecessors — and won a majority in every region, including the most traditional and conservative, according to Casanova. Ukraine invasion — explained  If Russia's invasion of Ukraine feels familiar, look to Broadway in the '60s \"In no other European country could you have ... a president, a prime minister being Jewish without having a lot of antimseitic propaganda in media and in newspapers,\" he says. \"It never became an issue.\" The Holocaust took a personal toll on Zelenskyy's family. Three of his grandfather's brothers were killed by the Germans, he said  in a January 2020 speech .  \"He survived World War II contributing to the victory over Nazism and hateful ideology,\" he said of his grandfather. \"Two years after the war, his son was born. And his grandson was born 31 years after. Forty years later, his grandson became president.\"  Enlarge this image Protesters rallied outside the Russian Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand on Friday, after Russian forces invaded Ukraine.

Lauren DeCicca/Getty Images Experts and observers criticize Putin's \"mythical use of history\"  Putin's claims contradict and distort important parts of 20th-century history while furthering his own agenda, the experts tell NPR.  They characterize it as an effort to hark back to the Soviet Union's heroism in fighting fascism during WWII.  But Casanova notes that Ukraine \"suffered more than Russia from Nazi tanks,\" saying it lost more of its population during the war than any other country (without counting Europe's 6 million Jewish victims as a nation).  He calls Putin's tactics \"simply a mythical use of history\" to justify present-day crimes.  Ukraine invasion — explained  After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Jerusalem's Putin Pub is now just named Pub It's true that many Ukrainian nationalists initially welcomed the  German invaders as liberators  during WWII and collaborated with the occupation, a fact that Ukraine's small far-right movement is quick to emphasize. Putin's claims seize on that kernel of truth but distort it — a classic Soviet  propaganda tactic .  Lautman, who is Ukrainian and Russian, says Russia considers WWII its biggest victory and places a big emphasis on its defeat of the Nazis, celebrating WWII Soviet holidays many times a year. Russian television channels played WWII movies on the day of Putin's announcement about invading Ukraine, Lautman says, which she describes as an appeal to the older generation.  And Russian leaders have successfully rewritten parts of that history, she says. For example, Putin  signed a ban on comparisons between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany last July. That means someone could be jailed for mentioning the collaboration between Hitler and Josef Stalin, Lautman explains. Culture  For Ukrainian-Americans, unity against Putin has solidified their bonds Jockusch notes another gap in Russia's retelling of its 20th-century history. \"Stalin perpetrated a man-made famine that can be called a genocide in Ukraine 90 years ago, the 'Holodomor' which Russia still does not recognize and which claimed some 3 million Ukrainian lives,\" she says.  So why would Putin use this particular language to justify an invasion now? Lautman says Putin has long mourned the collapse of the Soviet Union and has \"nothing to show\" despite having been in power for two decades.  \"If he's able to reclaim some of this lost territory, on top of having a few satellite states, which he's been attempting to do over the past decade ... then at least he would have a legacy to leave in the history books of Vladimir the Great,\" she says.

Olga Maltseva/AFP via Getty Images What this distortion of history can teach us  While the West may not have been paying close attention before, many critics in Europe and beyond are now pushing back on Putin's claims.  Lautman says Ukrainians are used to this kind of language, since it's consistent with what Russia has been putting into the information sphere over the last eight years. And despite strict media censorship in Russia — where outlets aren't even allowed to refer to the current incursion as a war — citizens are risking imprisonment by protesting in the streets.  Ukraine invasion — explained  Antiwar protesters take to the streets around the world in support of Ukraine Yale historian Timothy Snyder described the charge of denazification as a perversion of values,  telling CNN that it is \"meant to confound us and discourage us and confuse us, but the basic reality is that Putin has everything turned around.\"  He said Putin's goal appears to be to take Kyiv, arrest Ukraine's political and civil leaders to get them out of power and then try them in some way. That's where the language of genocide comes in, he added.  \"I think it's very likely, and he's said as much, that he intends to use the genocide and denazification language to set up some kind of kangaroo court which would serve the purpose of condemning these people to death or ... prison or incarceration.\"  Casanova and Lautman praise the strength and determination of Ukrainians, noting they are putting up a resistance. If Russia does succeed, Lautman says she is confident it would round up and execute political leaders and journalists there.  Europe  The ICC says it will open an investigation into alleged war crimes in Ukraine The experts point to the importance of learning from history and the present moment, something that the U.S. and other countries have not always done.  Casanova says the current moment proves that the world must create an equitable security system that is \"not manipulated by the superpowers.\"  And both he and Lautman call for the world to hold Russia accountable, including by trying it for war crimes in international court. (The top prosecutor at the International Criminal Court  said on Monday \"[We have to] understand that Ukraine today is the sacrificial lamb for all the unwillingness of the West to act united in defense of its own norms and values, in defense of the world security system that they tried to establish,\" Casanova says. \"And if they can't fight for that, I don't know for what they can fight.\""
