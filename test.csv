the first days of the welladvertised ukrainian counteroffensive have borne no tangible results prompting disappointment among western military analysts whats behind the failure t t t russias special operation in ukraine us ukraine kiev russia antony blinken nato russian ministry of defense leopardi would say that the counteroffensive is less than what [the west expect[s michael maloof former senior security policy analyst in the us office of the secretary of defense told sputnik the extent to which the ukrainians are undertaking any socalled counteroffensive is more of a probing action than an actual assault and onslaught per maloof the failure could be largely attributed to poor planning lack of manpower resources and training western wonderweapons bite the dustthe ukrainian military has so far failed in all directions of their counteroffensive despite receiving billions of dollars worth of military equipment from the us and its nato allies in the first week alone the kiev regime forces lost thousands of casualties along with more than a dozen of german leopardtanks nearly two dozen of usmade bradley infantry fighting vehicles ifvs and several french amx rc light tanks the pictures of destroyed western military equipment have already been circulated by the media and social networks the russian armed forced has destroyed a vast amount of ukraines military equipment since day one of the special military operation including airplanes and helicopters  unmanned aerial vehicles air defence missile systems  tanks and other armoured combat vehicles  combat vehicles equipped with mrls  field artillery cannons and mortars as well as units of special military equipment according to the russian ministry of defense matviychuk has drawn attention to the fact that the russian military has repeatedly participated in local conflicts and peace missions starting from therefore despite all the shortcomings of the collapse of the soviet union the russian military equipment has undergone development and is up to date in terms of modern warfare challenges he placed special emphasis on maneuverability flaws of western armored vehicles per him the eastern european military theater with its freeze river floods mud swamps and other critical weather conditions became a serious challenge for the nato military equipment the ukrainian military has faced a plethora of logistic problems including that the german ton battle tanks could not cross some of ukraines bridges europe and the world have suddenly realized that westernstyle equipment is not second to none in many respects that it has its own shortcomings along with its advantages according to the military analyst how could kievs failures affect weapons supplies russias relatively rapid obliteration of western weapons and lack of any tangible victories on the front could affect weapons supplies according to sputniks interlocutors kiev politicians have already urged their western patrons to provide even more military equipment and armored vehicles to replace those destroyed every leopardis literally as good as gold for the decisive offensive ukrainian deputy foreign minister andrii melnyk told the german press on sunday however german defense minister boris pistorius announced earlier this week that berlin cannot replace every leopard tank destroyed on the ukrainian battlefield he asserted to kiev that germany will continue to supply repaired leoparda tanks starting from july and by the end of the year there will be more than a hundred of them [in ukraines service the minister said however according to international military observers it would be too little too late the biden administration has disbursed anothermillion to provide the kiev regime with additional m bradley infantry fighting vehicles ifvs to replace those lost over the past week as well as ammo for himars and nasams the collective west is going to maximize its support for the ukrainian counteroffensive and provide kiev with longterm aid as us secretary of state antony blinken has promised still according to maloof this enthusiasm will be shortlived whos to blame for counteroffensive failure while assessing the ukraine armys failures western analysts suggested that it stems from the lack of training in general the western observers tend to pin the whole blame on ukrainian soldiers unfamiliar with the nato equipment its not fair as per matviychuk in fact the western military industrial complex has been given a black eye rheinmetall ag a german automotive and arms manufacturer has already lostof the value of the shares due to the fact that the leopards got rapidly destroyed noted matviychuk this is reputational damage to the us defense contractors too he continued the us armored vehicles proved quite efficient in the fight against shepherds in afghanistan and iraq but in eastern europe they failed en masse which indicates the low quality of equipment in the first place per the military expert westerners started protestingit appears that the western public has grown weary of the russoukrainian conflict as well as of nato member states spending billions on weapons for kiev at the expense of their domestic economies and social programs matviychuk appears to share maloofs stance in poland there are rallies against the presence of ukrainians and the supply of weapons in bulgaria there are thousands of rallies and germany was generally divided along the axis of the former gdr and the former frg … even in the united states some congressmen say that it is necessary to urgently stop the supply of weapons [to kiev i think that as the conflict develops and aggravates the majority of socially prominent citizens will advocate for an end to the war as they are aware of the detriment first of all for their countries

anything other than antirussia show trial analysts the hague sentenced two russian nationals and one ukrainian to life in prison in absentia on thursday for their alleged roles in thedowning of a malaysia      sputnik international t t t mh incident flight mh ruling court ruling ukraine russia analysis thursday’s longawaited hague ruling on malaysian airlines flight mh was a “foregone conclusion ” and the only decision to be expected from the court given the politicized nature of the trial and the geopolitical implications at stake international legal experts ir analysts and political commentators have told sputnik citing the mh incident as a “classic case of ‘false flag’ operations” by kiev aimed at ramping up western pressure against moscow doctorow pointed out that unlike this week’s ww scare involving a ukrainian air defense missile falling on polish territorywhich kiev immediately blamed on russia but the west surprisingly questioned the us and its allies did not intervene in mh into swat down ukrainian claims “with mh the usa pointed the finger at russia minutes after the crash but then this was only a propaganda play in the information wars that had the objective of bringing europe on board for severe sanctions against russia however with the missile hitting poland yesterday first the polish president and then joe biden said within hours that while a proper investigation was needed the available intelligence on the trajectory of the missile excluded its being fired from russia why this very different development of the case because there is a proxy war going on now and usanato did not want an escalation to nuclear war through pushing a false flag story ” the observer suggested political commentator and author joe quinn echoed doctorow’s characterization of the verdict as a “foregone conclusion ” suggesting the hague “was always going to find russia guilty ” because that was “the premise of the investigation from the outset ”the commentator suggested that “any sober analysis” of the jits findings would show that the investigation was slanted against these ‘russianbacked separatists’ “and by extension [against russia ” to prove them guilty “to reach this conclusion they were required to avoid giving any serious credence to evidence presented by the russian government the jits final conclusions were primarily based on unnamed eyewitnesses and insiders the credibility of the statements of these people has not been subject to impartial scrutiny ” quinn said asked why the us never bothered to release satellite data related to the mh crash which could prove russias innocence the commentator emphasized that the us government “has a vested interest in withholding any and all information that would disprove” the ‘russia did it’ thesis “the same applies to the authorities in kiev and holland ”quinn is convinced that there was “zero possibility” for the verdict to be anything other than it was since the destruction of mh was a “political event” – one “that occurred in the context of the ongoing geopolitical rivalry between russia and the us and more broadly east vs west Tiberius Graziani chairman of vision amp global trends a romebased geopolitical affairs think tank expressed similar sentiments saying that “given the current circumstances related to the crisis between the west and the russian federation ” thursday’s verdict could not have been nonpolitical “russia was not allowed to participate in the trial in which it was directly accused precisely because it was considereda priori – guilty from the outset we recall that the tragic event was used right from the start in the context of the long hybrid war that the west has waged since at least the early years of this century furthermore in [this specific case the question of the insurance companies that will have to pay the damages must also be taken into account Graziani said ‘farce masquerading as a trial’christopher c black an international criminal and human rights lawyer with overyears of experience covering war crimes and international relations under his belt provided sputnik with an indepth account of the question marks surrounding the mh saga and like his counterparts above characterized thursday’s verdict as the “conclusion of a farce masquerading as a trial ”black pointed out that from the outset washington and its allies blamed the donbass republics for shooting down the passenger airliner despite no evidence that the militias even had access to the sophisticated buk antiaircraft missiles allegedly used in the crime but which kiev did have “also ignored was the eyewitness evidence of civilians on the ground who observed at least one kiev sukhoi su fighter jet ascend and approach the civilian airliner and that immediately afterwards the plane crashed there were reports as well that a spanish air traffic controller in kiev known as carlos sent out messages on twitter contemporaneous with the shoot down using the twitter address spainbuca that he observed this on his radar and overheard the pilot’s conversations with kiev air traffic control confirming that the ukraine jet shot down the plane there are later reports that a ukrainian pilot admitted he flew the plane that shot it down both these men have since disappeared from view remarkably the investigating body has never followed up these important facts ” black emphasized the observer noted that the hague has refused to follow up on any information related to the incident provided by the russian government and pointed out that since the plane was downed in donbass territory under international law it should have been the donetsk people’s republic which led the investigation into the plane’s destruction recognition or no recognition “but the donetsk republic was denied that role by the kiev regime which claimed it took place in ukraine territory and so assumed the role of investigator and then under nato and especially american pressure delegated the investigation to nato in the guise of the dutch safety board on the justification that the majority of the passengers were dutch ” black said black stressed that the dutch safety board’sreport on the incident simply ignored any evidence pointing to kiev’s responsibility for the plane’s destruction such as the holes found in the airliner’s fuselage which “match the mm cannon shells used by the kiev sukhoi su…seen approaching the plane ”black also pointed to the mysterious januarydetention by dutch police of a pair of journalists and the seizure of their equipment cameras phones notes and interview materials on mh characterizing that incident as a blatant attempt by the dutch government to suppress the evidence these journalists gathered it is only reasonable to conclude that the nato authorities are worried in case these journalists found evidence confirming nato culpability for the incident after all [they had written an article about it and announced that they were willing to share the information with the dutch government but apparently there is a fear in nato that they might share too much with too many and so pounced on them and robbed them and us of the information they had before they could the dutch government has yet to offer a legal justification for this seizure ” the observer said the hague district court found russian nationals igor girkin aka igor streklov and sergei dubinsky and ukrainian leonid kharchenko guilty in the downing of mh sentencing them in absentia to life in jail the men were also ordered to pay overmillion euros in compensation to the families of thevictims of the plane crash moscow blasted the politicized decision malaysia airlines boeingflight mh went down in the eastern donetsk peoples republic on july while on route from amsterdam to kuala lumpur the planes route over the donbass was approved by ukrainian authorities despite the fact that kiev forces and local militias were engaged in fierce clashes in the area allpeople aboard the aircraft were killed

potential ukrainian false flag operation involving adirty bomb i e an explosive device loaded with radioactive materials the western mainstream press has been routinely downplaying or neglecting the issue as well as kievs apparent prowess to create atomic weapons and ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskys remark about dropping the nonnuclear status made at the munich security conference on february  on top of that the ukrainian press has openly discussed kievs optionsto create nuclear arms in fiveseven years or even in the matter of months in case the nation acquires a reactor for the production of weaponsgrade plutonium per busby those who are flirting with the idea of nonpeaceful use of nuclear energy in ukraine are playing with fire those people who are driving this process towards an eventual nuclear exchange have no idea what it will be like i have studied the effects of radiation on life not just human life but all life the calculations made by those who wargame nuclear exchanges are based on false and obsolete science the reality is very like mad max in this case hollywood got it right busby concluded  "

blowing up the dam while russia has blamed ukraine thousands of people have been evacuated from lowlying areas either side of the river dnipro un humanitarian aid chief martin griffiths has warned of grave and farreaching consequences herex s what we know so far where is the dam the kakhovka hydroelectric power plant is in the city of nova kakhovka in the kherson region the city is currently under russian occupation the dam was built in the soviet era and is one of six that sit along the dnipro river which stretches from the very north of the country into the black sea in kherson region russia occupies the left or southern bank while ukraine controls the right or northern bank the dam holds back a huge reservoir which locals call the kakhovka sea as you cannot see the other bank in certain places what happened video footage showed a massive breach in the dam with water surging through it and flooding downstream in the direction of kherson ukrainian dam operator ukrhydroenerho said the nova kakhovka station was quot fully destroyedquot and could not be restored itx s unclear when exactly the dam was first damaged but satellite images suggest its condition deteriorated over a number of days as water from the vast kakhovka reservoir poured through the damaged dam agricultural land and dozens of villages and towns were quickly flooded thousands of people from both sides of the river have been evacuated from their homes but the full scale of the disaster is not yet clear satellite images reveal scale of dam tragedy there are also major environmental concerns the river has been contaminated withtonnes of industrial lubricant said president volodymyr zelensky and anothertonnes was at risk of leaking agricultural land has been washed away and the consequences of the flooding on local farmland is likely to be felt for years landmines are also being dislodged by the floodwaters prompting concerns not just for residents in kherson but also those coming to provide assistance president zelensky visited the floodhit region on thursday and said the priority was to quot protect lives and help people as much as possiblequot  he also visited a crossing point in the city where people were being evacuated from the flooded area and a medical facility has the dam been attacked itx s not yet clear what caused the breach in the dam but ukrainex s military has accused russia of deliberately blowing it up moscow may have feared that ukrainian forces would use the road over the dam to get troops across the river into russianheld territory as part of a counteroffensive Mykola Kalinin chief engineer at a hydropower and water management engineering company in ukraine ukrhydroproject claimed that an explosion was the cause the dam he told ukrainian data journalism site texty was quot built to withstand a superpowerful impact from the outsidequot  mr kalinin concludes that it was mined from the inside but kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov blamed ukraine calling it an act of quot sabotagequot that would deprive the crimean peninsulaan area annexed by russia inof water neither ukraine nor russiax s claims have been verified by the bbc alternative theories of what could have caused or at least contributed to the breaching of the dam have been put forward fighting in the area could have affected the structure mark mulligan professor of physical geography at university college london told the bbc a second theory he put forward was that russia which controls the dam deliberately allowed water levels to rise in the reservoir behind itmaking a collapse more likely and more impactful according to analysis of satellite imagery carried out by theus foreign agricultural service water levels rose sharply over the last few months however the damx s destruction is hard to assess on satellite imagery alone as much of the damage is underwater mr zelensky has accused the international community of not reacting fast enough to the flooding and said without drinking water food or medicine it was impossible to know how many people would die he has accused international organisations like the red cross of losing the ability to save lives the world bank has offered to conduct a rapid assessment of the damage and ukrainex s most urgent needs what was the purpose of the dam it held back a vast reservoir that supplied water to communities upstream and provided cooling water to the nuclear power station at zaporizhzhia around kmmiles away which is under russian control the international atomic energy agency iaea said there was no immediate nuclear safety risk but it was monitoring the situation it later said that if the dam did fall below m the lowest level at which water can still be pumped upstream to zaporizhzhia there were alternative water sources to keep the nuclear plant cool the dam was also a vital channel carrying water from the river to russianoccupied crimea meaning water supplies there are likely to be affected after russia annexed crimea in ukraine blocked a channel carrying water from nova kakhovka triggering a water crisis on the peninsula russian forces reopened the channel after last yearx s invasion but without the dam dropping water levels could once again jeopardise the flow of water along the channel russia has previously carried out several attacks on dams throughout ukraine since the invasion causing widespread flooding and disrupting power supplies

some experts told nbc news that the risk of a widespread radiation leak was low “it is actually quite difficult to arrange a significant reactive incident here said Pavel Podvig a senior researcher at the united nations institute for disarmament research in geneva “even if you try to blow it up i don’t think you could spread” the radiation beyond a few hundred yards ukraine has warned for months thatrussia might try to blow up the nuclear plant but rarely have these warnings been as specific as president volodymyr zelenskyy was late tuesday when he said russia had placed “objects resembling explosives” on the roof — perhaps intending to blame an attack on ukraine “it is the responsibility of everyone in the world to stop it ” he said in his latest appeal for more assistance from allies “no one can stand aside as radiation affects everyone ” the kremlin has presented its own version of events president vladimir putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said wednesday that the russiancontrolled plant was at risk of “sabotage” by ukraine the deputy adviser at the russian energy giant rosenergoatom renat karchaa said ukraine was planning to strike the plant with a tactical ballistic missile tipped with a nuclear wastefilled warhead russias stateowned news agency ria novosti reported tuesday nbc news has not verified the claims of either side the international atomic energy agency has issued regular warnings about the danger of fighting around a nuclear plant it said in a statement wednesday that partial inspections had revealed no evidence of mines or other explosives but that it had not been granted access to the whole site it added that no shelling or explosions have been reported recently and that the military presence at the site appeared unchanged the iaea says it has been given partial access to inspect the plant shown here last month afpgetty images this part of the world doesn’t need to imagine what nuclear catastrophe looks like aroundmiles northwest of zaporizhzhia the meltdown of the chernobyl nuclear power plant inremains the worst of its kind on record some people were evacuated radioactive material was blown across the northern hemisphere and scientists say a mile exclusion zone may not be safe for years the halflife of the plutonium released though officially fewer thanpeople died the meltdown resulted in a “far higher than normal” rate of thyroid cancer among children in the area according to the iaea comparisons are inevitable then particularly given thatzaporizhzhia is almost twice the size of chernobyl and finds itself in the midst of a modern land war ukrainian emergency workers such as this person clad in protective gear last week have been training in the event of an incident at the nuclear plant evgeniy maloletkaap many in eastern ukraine have felt increasing panic this week fueled by a fervent rumor mill on the popular telegram messaging app which residents check throughout the night the countrys deputy defense minister Hanna the painter said wednesday that emergency services across four regions had been doing days of extra training to cope with a possible terrorist attack on the plant these fears were hardly tempered last week when local russianinstalled government officials said they had evacuated people includingchildren from the area around the plant the area has also already seen what happens when a colossal piece of vital infrastructure is destroyed last month farther down the dnieper river the kakhovka dam burst apparently following an explosion flooding homes and forcing thousands of residents to flee while threatening an ecological catastrophe zelenskyy himself said the muted international reaction to this — he blames russia but his allies have not publicly apportioned blame — “may incite the kremlin to commit new evil ” zaporizhzhia was captured in the early days of the war by russian soldiers who have guarded it ever since the region is on the front lines of ukrainex s counteroffensive ap file most experts agree that any nuclear power plant should be offlimits in conflict but some disagree about how bad an explosion at zaporizhzhia would be in terms of a widespread nuclear disaster “if you blow up nuclear fuel you’re going to get contamination ” said hamish de brettongordon the former commander of britains and nato’s chemical biological and nuclear defense forces “you’re not going to get a nuclear explosion but the fires potentially created could spread contamination as happened at chernobyl ” zaporizhzhia is more modern than chernobyl built in the early s aroundyears after construction of its infamous cousin began and de brettongordon said its far more sturdy design aimed at withstanding being hit by a jetliner means the risk would come only from a blast inside the facility itself but other experts have said that fundamental differences between the design of two plants means that the risk of widespread radiation contamination is low regardless the training for ukrainian emergency workers this weekend involved treating people who might be affected by an emergency at the facility evgeniy maloletkaap the zaporizhzhia plants reactors are housed inside stainless steel containment vessels which themselves are placed inside walls of thick reinforced concrete unlike chernobyl its design does not use graphite the material that caught fire in theincident and spread radioactive material into the atmosphere zaporizhzhia’s six reactors “are not at all like the chernobyl reactor and cannot can not have the same kind of accident ”wrote cheryl rofer a retired nuclear researcher who worked for more thanyears at the los alamos national laboratory the u s government facility in new mexico the institute for the study of war a washingtonbased think tank agreed it was unlikely that limited russian sabotage at zaporizhzhia would be able to generate a massive radiological incident perhaps most crucially all six of zaporizhzhia’s reactors are currently in cold shutdown meaning they are far cooler than those in chernobyl or fukushima the plant that melted down following japan’s earthquake and tsunami in i dont think these accusations and counteraccusations are very helpful said feat at the u n institute for disarmament research “the message should be that the plant should be off limits for any military action — and i would probably say for propaganda too ”

julnearly russian men have died in the war in ukraine according to the first independent statistical analysis of russia’s war dead two independent russian media outlets mediazona and meduza working with a data scientist from germany’s tübingen university used russian government data to shed light on one of moscow’s closestheld secrets — the true human cost of its invasion of ukraine to do so they relied on a statistical concept popularised during the covid pandemic called excess mortality drawing on inheritance records and official mortality data they estimated how many more men below the age ofdied between februaryand maythan normal neither moscow nor kyiv gives timely data on military losses and each is at pains to amplify the other side’s casualties russia has publicly acknowledged the deaths of just about soldiers a building destroyed by a russian air attack in orikhiv zaporizhia region ukraine [head of the zaporizhia regional military administration yurii malashkotelegramhandout via reuters reports about military losses have been repressed in russian media activists and independent journalists say documenting the dead has become an act of defiance and those who do so face harassment and potential criminal charges despite such challenges mediazona and bbc news russian working with a network of volunteers have used social media postings and photographs of cemeteries across russia to build a database of confirmed war deaths as of july they had identified dead russian soldiers “these are only soldiers who we know by name and their deaths in each case are verified by multiple sources ” said dmitry treshchanin an editor at mediazona who helped oversee the investigation “the estimate we did with meduza allows us to see the ‘hidden’ deaths deaths the russian government is so obsessively and unsuccessfully trying to hide ” to come up with a more comprehensive tally journalists from mediazona and meduza obtained records of inheritance cases filed with the russian authorities their data from the national probate registry contained information about more thanmillion people who died betweenand may according to their analysis  more inheritance cases were opened infor males agedtothan expected by may  the number of excess cases had shot up to  that surge is roughly in line with a may assessment by the white house that more than russians had been killed in ukraine since december though lower than the us and uk intelligence assessments of overall russian deaths in february the uk ministry of defence said approximately to russians had likely been killed in the war a leaked assessment from the us defense intelligence agency put the number of russians killed in action in the first year of the war at to  “their figures might be accurate or they might not be ” trashchanin the mediazona editor said in an email “even if they have sources in the russian ministry of defence its own data could be incomplete it’s extremely difficult to pull together all of the casualties from the army rosgvardia akhmat battalion various private military companies of which wagner is the largest but not the only one casualties among inmates first recruited by wagner and now by the mod are also a very hazy subject with a lot of potential for manipulation statistics could actually give better results ” many russian deaths – as well as amputations – could have been prevented with better frontline first aid the uk ministry of defence said in an intelligence assessment published on monday russia has suffered an average of aboutcasualties a day formonths creating a “crisis” in combat medical care that is likely undermining medical services for civilians in border regions near ukraine the ministry said independently dmitry kobak a data scientist from tübingen university who has published work on excess covid deaths in russia obtained mortality data broken down by age and sex forfrom rosstat russia’s official statistics agency he found that more men below the age ofdied inthan expected a figure that aligns with the analysis of inheritance data the covid pandemic made it harder to figure out how many men would have died in russia since februaryif there had not been a war both analyses corrected for the lingering effects of covid on mortality by indexing male death rates against female deaths sergey scherbov a scholar at the international institute for applied systems analysis in austria cautioned that “differences in the number of deaths between males and females can vary significantly due to randomness alone” “i am not saying that there couldn’t be an excess number of male deaths but rather that statistically speaking this difference in deaths could be a mere outcome of chance ” he said russians who are missing but not officially recognised as dead as well as citizens of ukraine fighting in units of the selfproclaimed donetsk and luhansk republics are not included in these counts kobak acknowledged that some uncertainties remain especially regarding the deaths of older men moreover it is hard to know how many missing russian soldiers are actually dead but he said neither factor is likely to have a huge effect “that uncertainty is in the thousands ” he said “the results are plausible overall ” the russian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment meduza is an independent russian media outlet that has been operating in exile for eight years with headquarters in riga latvia in april russian authorities designated meduza a “foreign agent” making it harder to generate advertising income and in january the kremlin banned it as an illegal “undesirable organisation” moscow has also labelled independent outlet mediazona as a “foreign agent” and blocked its website after russia’s fullscale invasion of ukraine

ukraine to join in a historic step that could deter moscow but that might also increase the risk of a usrussia war biden has staked his foreign policy legacy on arming ukraine to repel the russian invasion – most recently with a contentious decision to sendcluster bombs but he nevertheless sent a strong message to kyiv in anexclusive cnn interview that its increasingly sharp campaign is unlikely to result in a certain date for nato entry emerging from the alliance’s summit in lithuania this week while some eastern european alliance members are bullish on an early timetable to welcome ukraine some firstgeneration states including the us are more cautious partly due to fears that moving quickly on nato membership could provoke the direct conflict with russia that biden is desperate to avoid president joe biden speaks with cnns fareed zakaria during a televised interview inside the roosevelt room at the white house in washington on friday july  tom brenner for cnn cnn exclusive biden says war with russia must end before nato can consider membership for ukraine “i don’t think there is unanimity in nato about whether or not to bring ukraine into the nato family now at this moment in the middle of a war ” biden said in an interview with cnn’s fareed zakaria broadcast on sunday the president said that the alliance needed to lay out a “rational path” for ukraine’s membership but that it was still short of some requirements for joining including over democratization while biden said he had discussed the issue at length with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky and had refused before the war to allow russian president vladimir putin a veto on kyiv’s eventual membership his comments will disappoint ukraine as it suffers through a horrific war that has seen multiple crimes against humanity ukraine has often warned it is fighting the west’s war against russian expansionism and has weakened nato’s top adversary in europe and so therefore has a moral case for the defense guarantees nato states enjoy but even zelensky accepts that ukraine cannot join nato while the war rages on still he hinted in an interview with abc news aired sunday that he wouldn’t be a guest at the nato summit “for fun” and could stay away unless there was more clarity on membership and security guarantees “it would be an important message to say that nato is not afraid of russia ” he said a fateful decisiondeciding whether ukraine joins nato is one of the most fateful european security questions since waves of expansion took the alliance right up to russia’s borders in a process advocates say guaranteed postcold war peace by deterring kremlin aggression critics of enlargement into formerly soviet eastern europe however argue the process humiliated moscow turned it back into an avowed foe of the west and helped lead to the invasion of ukraine a decision to admit ukraine would extend the sacred nato pledge that an attack on one member is an attack on all to a nation russia regards at a minimum as part of its sphere of influence – even if such a claim has no basis in international law it would commit future western leaders to go to war with nucleararmed russia and potentially risk a third world war if the kremlin attacked its neighbor again reps michael mccaul and barbara lee getty images a top house republican backs bidenx s decision to send cluster munitions to ukraine while a prominent democrat disagrees supporters of ukraine’s membership in nato however argue that decades of security and territorial integrity provided to exwarsaw pact nations like poland hungary and romania are in itself proof that once under nato’s mutual defense umbrella ukraine would at last be safe from future incursions by moscow the argument is especially resonant since summit host lithuania like its fellow baltic states latvia and estonia was once annexed by the soviet union and considered highly vulnerable to russia before its entry into nato in source cnn video ad feedback why nato is so significant in the westx s relationship with russia source cnn the case for ukraine in nato broadly the case for nato welcoming ukraine includes those ironclad security guarantees that would be designed to dispel its vulnerability to russian attack supporters of kyiv’s accession point out that a vague promise of future membership – first made at its summit in bucharest inwith no realistic timetable for entry – offered putin an incentive to invade before ukraine joined the club nato membership would also boost ukraine’s bid to cement a democracy that was vulnerable before the war and fulfill the desire of many of its people to join the west with its brutal war moscow has forfeited any moral say in whether ukraine should join or not and the addition of europe’s most battlehardened army with more personnel under arms than most member states would stiffen nato’s military punch sens lindsey graham a south carolina republican and richard blumenthal a connecticut democrat last week introduced a resolution calling for a roadmap to ukraine’s nato membership as soon as it is practicable “it is only through nato membership that ukraine can experience true security in the face of repeated russian aggression ” the senators said in a statement “their fight has been a stand against corrupt crony authoritarianism and they have earned a secure and lasting peace within nato ” the case against there are short and longterm arguments against nato offering membership to ukraine biden warned in his cnn interview that to do so in a time of war would immediately commit the alliance to defend a new partner – to prove the group’s collective defense is meaningful “i mean what i say ” the president said “it’s a commitment that we’ve all made no matter what if the war is going on then we’re all in war we’re at war with russia if that were the case ”offering ukraine a set date to join after the war ends might be counterproductive since it would give the kremlin a rationale for never ending the conflict this would dash admittedly thin hopes for a political settlement if ukraine’s forces are ultimately unable to expel all russian forces and it would risk strengthening putin at home by appearing to justify one of his rationales for the unprovoked invasion – his baseless allegation that the west triggered the war to claim ukraine in a bid to weaken russian power libkosap russiax s war in ukraine as he headed to the united kingdom on the first leg of his european visit biden got an endorsement of his strategy from gop rep michael mccaul the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee who said it was “way too premature” to talk about ukraine immediately joining nato “first they have to win the counteroffensive secondly have a ceasefire and then negotiate a peace settlement we cannot admit ukraine into nato immediately that would put us at war with russia ” the texas republican said on cnn’s “state of the union” on sunday “so i think what the conversation is going to be about is what security agreements can be put in place with ukraine as a predicate to perhaps ascension of ukraine into nato ” he said adding “we have to be careful in the way we do this ” us and european security guarantees to ukraine – beyond the multibillion dollar effort to arm the country to fend off russia’s threat – would change the strategic picture in western europe they would also be made with no guarantee that the kremlin would become more benign toward the west in future decades but there is no reason for example why the us and its allies cannot make a commitment to offer ukraine the means to defend itself – short of nato membership – much as the us does with israel and taiwan the risk of a clash with russia in the future weighs heavily on the minds of many analysts “the united states should not guarantee ukrainian security period ” said ben friedman policy director at defense priorities a think tank dedicated to promoting a realist vision of national security policy “we shouldn’t do so now via nato or otherwise through some sort of bilateral security guarantees and we shouldn’t do so as part of a peace deal ”friedman argued that despite ukraine’s heroic resistance wider considerations of washington’s interests must take priority “guaranteeing ukraine’s security would erode us security by increasingly the risk obviously of war with russia ” he said “that contains the risk of course of nuclear escalation and for that risk i think the united states receives basically nothing of security value ” neither biden nor any other member of his administration have made a case to the american people as to why ultimately it would be in the interest ofmillion americans to go to war with moscow to defend ukraine if it joined nato in fact the president has made an opposite implicit case stressing that despite a proxywar type situation in ukraine his core concern is avoiding a direct clash with russia advocates of nato welcoming ukraine often argue that no such undertaking was secured from american voters regarding other formally communist eastern european states once in the soviet union’s orbit but ukraine could be more at risk since it carries greater cultural and historical associations – and for russia it is linked to its selfidentity whether justified or not one potential downfall of offering ukraine eventual security guarantees through nato or another mechanism would be if political will to enforce them ebbs in future a failure to defend such guarantees would raise grave doubts about nato’s existing mutual defense ethos and could end up disastrously weakening the integrity of the alliance even if biden were to amend his position on accelerating nato membership for ukraine he cannot ensure a successor would honor treaty obligations indeed expresident donald trump has been loudly warning that biden is leading the us into a potential world war iii against russia and he has insisted he’d end the war in ukraine withinhours if elected to a new term such comments suggest more sympathy to the goals of putin to whom he has often cozied up the uncertain political situation in the us may be one reason why zelensky has appeared so desperate to ensure his country’s urgent nato aspirations are set in stone at this week’s summit

around the world “perhaps to simulate an attack on the plant perhaps they have some other scenario ” zelensky speculated but on one point he was unequivocal “in any case the world sees – can’t but see – that the only source of danger to the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is russia and no one else ” russian president vladimir putin has long flirted with thenuclear specter since mounting his invasion of ukraine zelensky has now raised the prospect that he may cause a nuclear incident not by firing warheads but by turning the znpp itself into a weapon but what would happen if the explosives that ukraine claims to have found were detonated could zaporizhzhia become another chernobyl and what good if any would this do for russia in its war on ukraine here’s what you need to know what is the current situation in june zelensky said ukrainian intelligence had “received information that russia is considering a scenario of a terrorist attack at the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant znpp ” and that the alleged attack would involve “radiation leakage ”ukraine’s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov told state tv that the russians had mined the zaporizhzhia plant “the most horrifying part is that a cooler is mined if they disable it by blowing it up… there is a great chance that there will be significant problems ” the kremlindenied the allegations zelensky significantly escalated this rhetoric in his address on tuesday night “the whole world must now realize that common security depends entirely on global attention to the actions of the occupiers at the plant ” he said as ukraine’s counteroffensive attempts to reclaim territory captured by russia including in the zaporizhzhia region analysts have said that russia may be mounting a false flag operation – a military action designed to look like it was perpetrated by the opponent that is russia may claim that any explosion at the power plant was the result of reckless ukrainian shelling rather than its own explosives throughout the war russia has warned that ukrainian shelling around the plant could lead to a radioactive incident “it’s rhetorical signaling meant to accuse ukraine of nuclear irresponsibility and then also to discourage ukraine from conducting counteroffensive operations into the occupied zaporizhzhia oblast ” Karolina Hird a russia analyst at the institute for the study of war told cnn kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov told reporters wednesday that the situation at the plant is “quite tense ” but tried to deflect criticism claiming that the potential for “sabotage by the kyiv regime” is “high” and could have “catastrophic consequences ” “therefore of course all measures are being taken to counter this threat ” peskov said the international atomic energy agency iaea – the united nations’ nuclear watchdog – said in an update wednesday that there were no visible indications of mines or explosives at the znpp but requested additional access to the site for confirmation “access to the rooftops of reactor unitsandis essential as well as access to the turbine halls and some parts of the cooling system of the plant ” iaea director general rafael grossi said in a statement who controls the power plant the znpp – the largest in europe – lies along the banks of the dnipro river next to the town of enerhodar it has been under full russian control since march last year but is operated mostly by ukrainian staff who were initiallyforced to work at “gunpoint” by invading russian troops according to petro kotin head of ukraine’s nuclear power operator energoatom when the war began on february one of the plant’s six reactor units was closed for maintenance after russian forces took control of the plant the ukrainian workers shut down the remaining units butfighting continued to rage around the plant last summer to the grave alarm of the iaea big claiming that “every principle of nuclear safety” had been “violated” at the plant managed tosecure his staff a visit to the site in august while it remained under russian control grossi points on a map of the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant march joe klamarafpgetty imagesfile grossi’s “personal diplomacy ” and the “bravery” of the staff who accompanied him on this visit played a huge role in decreasing the chance of a nuclear accident at the plant according to william alberque director of strategy technology and arms control at the international institute for strategy studies “what grossi is doing is completely unprecedented in the history of the iaea ” alberque told cnn “the whole thing was saying russia’s basically going to have to kill me in order for me not to make this nuclear power plant more safe it was astonishing ” the iaea staff’s mission alberque said was to “establish a precedent here that we’re willing to get involved and to try to take this chess piece off the board ” is the plant still active russian occupiers however continued to prevent ukrainian operators from putting each of the reactors into a safer “cold shutdown” status this means when the reactor’s temperature is below boiling point but electrical pumps moving water through the core must still keep working to cool the fuel and avoid meltdown – which requires an external power supply the safety of the plant was threatened further by the breach of the nova kakhovka dam on june which lowered water levels used for cooling the plant precipitously ukraine accused russia ofdeliberately destroying the dam – a claim that moscow has denied shortly after this the final reactor unit at znpp was put into cold shutdown status on june hence due to the actions of the iaea and ukrainian operating staff the plant has been put into a more stable “cold shutdown” mode limiting the chances of a largescale nuclear disaster the zaporizhzhia plant seen from the banks of the dnipro on june after the nova kakhovka dam collapse alina smutkoreuters could this be another chernobyl because the plant’s reactors have been cooled no if the reported explosives were to detonate this would “open up a cold reactor which would expose spent fuel to the air which will spread some radiation ” alberque told cnn “a plume will come off from the reactor where there will be radiation aerosolized ” he said this would create a radiation zone where “you’ll have a higher chance of cancer over the nextyears ” but will not recreate the sort of destruction seen after the meltdown of the active chernobyl plant in “the six reactors at znpp are not at all like the chernobyl reactor and cannot can not have the same kind of accident ” cheryl rofer a nuclear expert and former researcher at the los alamos national laboratory wrote in a blog “chernobyl had a graphite moderator and the building it was in was not the heavily reinforced concrete of the reactors at znpp the znpp reactors have hard oxide fuel encased in metal and are inside a stainless steel vessel chernobyl had no such vessel ” she added according to alberque the scale of the effects of any disaster at zaporizhzhia would be more akin to that atthree mile island in pennsylvania in rather than chernobyl– or evenfukushima rescuers attend an antiradiation drill on june in case of an emergency at the znpp stringerreuters would a nuclear incident benefit russia it is unclear how russia would benefit from causing an explosion at the plant “the winds are blowing east so it’s going to affect russians in terms of military effectiveness zero it’s just stupid ” alberque said any nuclear incident would “just be selfharm it would just harm russianheld territory… i don’t get the play ” as well as not providing clear military strategic gains for russia causing a nuclear incident may backfire diplomatically the financial timesreported that chinese president xi jinping has personally warned putin against using nuclear weapons in ukraine according to western and chinese officials the kremlin denied the report calling it “fiction ” however it adds to the sense that russia’s continued nuclear threats are causing reputational damage among its supposed allies warring parties do not tend to raise the nuclear specter lightly india and pakistan despite being locked in conflict for decades agreed into exclude nuclear facilities from their conflict zones recognizing the risk that such attacks pose they have exchanged a list of their nuclear facilities every year sinceto avoid any accidents hence russia’s reckless threats may contribute to further isolation on the world stage “if putin were to do this [cause an explosion at the znpp how does india – whose line is ‘unlike pakistan we’re the responsible nuclear power’ – how do they say that if we’re friends with the guy who just blew up a nuclear power plant ” alberque said

an if jade mcglynn putin has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to do the unthinkable this time western allies must be prepared tuejul edt last modified on tuejul edt ver since russia launched its fullscale invasion of ukraine westerncommentators policyadvisers andpolitical leaders have raised the spectre of nuclear war to argue against supplying ukrainians with weapons of selfdefence for fear of provoking russia but this cautious approach could backfire leading us closer to nuclear catastrophe for ukrainians the question of whether russia will sabotage the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant znpp europe’s largest located in southern ukraine has long been a “when” not an “if” last week ukrainian civilians and officials shared panicked messages on social media as fears of a potential attack crystallised russian embassies andvladimir putin’s spokesperson appeared to be preparing disinformation lines suggesting that ukraine which suffered so terribly from the chornobyl nuclear accident could deliberately unleash radioactive terror on its own people while unconvincing the rhetoric was an eerie and foreboding reminder of past kremlin disinformation campaigns following russian atrocities theskripal poisonings thebucha massacre thedowning of passenger jet mh and the destruction of thekakhovka dam the instinct by some of ukraine’s allies to reduce the risk of russia turning to its nuclear arsenal is entirely correct but the tactics are misguided the west’s mixed signals over its willingness to defend ukraine arewidely considered to have contributed to putin’s decision to launch his genocidal war since the invasionmonths ago putin appears to have remained convinced that he has the “strategic patience” tooutlast the west and assure his victory in his defence he can cite some compelling evidence to support his belief after russia’sannexation of crimea the us and eu responsewas underwhelming – limited to symbolic but often ineffective personal sanctions more recently the international community’smuted reaction to thekakhovka dam catastrophe will have hardly caused him to reconsider his strategy but in the absence of aclear coordinated plan to deal with russia’s escalating nuclear threats western leaders have edged us closer to the nuclear disaster they are seeking to avoid russia possesses the world’s largest nuclear arsenal a dubious achievement it is not shy ofbroadcasting a nuclear war would herald the end of global civilisation even use of atactical nuclear weapon resulting in a smaller explosion would be a catastrophe for ukraine any serious assessment of nuclear risk means not underestimating this but it is also crucial that western leaders consider the consequences of being cowed by putin’s threats which are designed to force the world to indulge his rapacious appetite to destroyukraine by providing ukraine with warwinning military support the west can send a message to the kremlin – and any other irredentist powers – that using nuclear threats will not work focusing on russia’s nuclear arsenal alone distracts from more immediate threats namely the allegedpositioning of explosives around znpp which has been under occupation by russian armed forces since march russia has amassed military personnel and equipment inside the facility and there are reports that the children and families of ukrainian operators forced to work at znpp arebeing held hostage in russia having been removed from the vicinity of the plant under the guise of “evacuation” against the backdrop of ongoing russian war crimes in ukraine the fear that the kremlin is preparing an act of nuclear terrorism is far from unreasonable when this could occur or what this act might look like remains unclear some experts suggest that it is likely russia will blow up a small part of the plant such as a cooled reactor to display what it is capable of or to slow down the ukrainian counteroffensive this would be unlikely to lead toradiation leakage – but there are also much riskier scenarios astronger explosion could cause damage to the protective shell of a reactor spreading radiation approximatelymiles from the site of the blast and creating a disaster of catastrophic scale perhaps the threats can be dismissed as part of russia’s information warfare – another way to terrorise the ukrainian civilian population last week ukrainian civilians were killed by russian missiles in lviv ukraine’s most western and peaceful city but nuclear catastrophe is not something to leave to chance or half measures the viennabased international atomic energy agency iaea has worked under trying conditions to ensure the safety of the plant but it has lost the confidence of many in ukraine in its latest inspection the iaea insisted the plant was secure but also requested further access as it was prevented from viewing parts of the site whereukrainian officials claim mines have been planted this situation is untenable much more robust action is needed to restore nuclear safety and confidence the best possible chance of demilitarising and deoccupying znpp would involve a multilateral taskforce formed of parties trusted by all sides including the us china india the uk and the eu which could supervise the area around the station with iaea support and expertise in the absence of such efforts much of europe remains hostage to fortune world leaders must now face up to some tough decisions rather than giving in once more to russian blackmail or ignoring the problem until it starts to radiate into ukraine’s atmosphere – and

president has yet to confirm his attendance amid suggestions that he may snub the alliance’s invitation to appear at the meeting in lithuania biden visits u k ahead of nato summit in lithuania get more news live on nbc news now print july   pm utc byyuliya talmazan andalexander smith london — the big question hanging overthe highprofile nato summit this weekis whether ukrainian presidentvolodymyr zelenskyy will show up the answer could either prove a galvanizing moment for the west in its support ofkyiv against russia or a humiliation though invited zelenskyy has yet to confirm his attendance with his officials saying he is not yet clear about what was being promised at the summit zelenskyy’s lastminute decision shines a spotlight on the divisions between kyiv and its foreign backers as the war passes its th day the central disagreement whether to invite ukraine to join nato and if so when and how the twoday summit opens tuesday in lithuania a former soviet republic that today is one of the most outspoken critics of russia’s war in ukraine president joe biden who stopped in london on monday en route to vilnius the lithuanian capital has said he doesn’t think ukraine is ready for full nato membership biden told cnn’s fareed zakaria that discussion around ukraine imminently joining nato was premature but he said the u s and its allies in nato would continue to provide kyiv with weaponry and support to end the war “i don’t think there is unanimity in nato about whether or not to bring ukraine into the nato family now at this moment in the middle of a war ” biden said ukraines joining nato as the war rages in the eyes of the u s and other allies such as germany would risk a fullblown conflict with anucleararmed russia president joe biden and ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy getty images file as national security adviser jake sullivan said at a briefing friday biden “has been clear that we are going to support ukraine for as long as it takes ” but “we are not seeking to start world war iii ” nato’s central pillar isarticle— the “all for one and one for all” clause that suggests allies and namely the colossal u s military will come to the aid of any fellow member that is attacked as such it’s unlikely that any concrete commitments on this front will emerge from the vilnius event but ukraine is nevertheless looking for verbal guarantees that extend beyond what it sees as the timid and vague assurances offered so far zelenskyy’s office did not immediately respond to nbc news’ requests for comment on whether zelenskyy would attend “it’s been very clear that ukraine wants some enhanced statement rather than just a reaffirmation of the opendoor policy ” said neil melvin director of international security studies at the royal united services institute a london think tank “but i think that the time frame will remain open and tied very much to when the war ends ”  for ukraine this is not just about its own safety but also providing a bulwark against russia trying to invade other countries farther into europe zelenskyy has been adamant since the early days of the war that ukraine needs to join nato for any longterm peace agreement to hold not only within ukraine but beyond its borders his country has been given promises in the past that have not borne fruit in ukraine and the former soviet republic of georgia were both told that they would become members of the alliance but crucially they were not given what’s known as a “membership action plan ” a formal pathway for any wouldbe nato member biden under pressure after providing cluster bombs to ukraine july  membership never happened for either country and later that yearrussia was at war with georgia andinmade its first incursion into ukraine and annexed its crimea peninsula so it’s against this backdrop that zelenskyy appears to be willing to stage something of a grand statement — snubbing his invitation as an honored guest — unless tangible assurances are offered there were encouraging signs for kyiv on monday ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kulebatweeted that nato had “reached consensus” on removing the membership action plan requirement from ukraine’s path into the alliance kuleba said it “shortens” ukraine’s path to nato and is the “best moment” to offer clarity on a membership invitation there was no immediate comment from nato but nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said friday that he expects the summit to yield a threepoint package to bring ukraine closer to nato a multiyear program of assistance increased political ties and “reaffirmation that ukraine will become a member of nato ” it comes at a key time for ukraine which is in the middle ofa counteroffensive to reclaim territory occupied by russia itself apparently weakened bythe brief wagner rebellion last month but with the counteroffensive going slower than planned ukraine is grasping for anything that could help turn the tide includingcluster munitions which washington last week agreed to provide after months of hesitation over themoral and reputational implications of supplying and using such weapons the weapons have been banned in more thancountries because they pose a lifethreatening danger to civilians long after conflict and the white house suggested last year that russia’s use of them in ukraine was a potential war crime meanwhile a poll released monday by the kyiv international institute of sociology suggestedof ukrainians want their country to join nato a desire that has grown steadily since crimea was annexed inand a military conflict broke out in the country’s east and yet while war rages the possibility of full membership for ukraine looks distant “i can’t see any prospect for ukraine joining nato before” there is “at the very least the liberation of all occupied territories ”said mark galeotti who heads the russiafocused consultancy mayak intelligence “no one wants in effect to commit nato to war with moscow ” nevertheless it’s an idea that in theory at least does have support among some western allies and to firm up that support this week zelenskyy went on a diplomatic offensive touring several nato member capitals turkey nato’s largest army after the u s  and czechia are among the countries that have recently said they back ukraine’s accession as soon as conditions allow ukraine knows it can’t change nato’s mind at such short notice according to Volodymyr Fesenko a ukrainian political analyst but zelenskyy wants to show biden that he has “sufficiently massive support of ukraine’s nato membership among” its member countries fesenko wrote in an analysis posted on facebook appearing in person would be crucial to that fesenko said other experts also said that it is in the ukrainian president’s interests to show his face at the summit in vilnius rather than stage a highprofile boycott lt gen ben hodges a former commander of the u s army in europe says he is “sure that president zelenskyy will appear in vilnius” so he can have some influence over the talks “he can see and sense the growing support for ukrainian membership” and “he knows that this is a long process yet his support across nato is growing ” said hodges who supports the country joining the alliance “he will be there in vilnius to demonstrate his determination his calm poised leadership and to remind everyone of the courage and sacrifice of ukraine from which all of europe is benefiting ” he said

would require ukrainian compromises bynbsp julie pace and hanna arhirova published [hour [minute [ampm [timezone [monthfull [day [year share share copy link copied email facebook twitter reddit pinterest flipboard print on a train from sumy to kyiv ukraine ap — ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy warned tuesday that unless his nation wins a drawnout battle in a key eastern city russia could begin building international support for a deal that could require ukraine to make unacceptable compromises he also invited the leader of china long aligned with russia to visit ifbakhmut fell to russian forces their president Vladimir Putin would “sell this victory to the west to his society to china to Iran ” zelenskyy said in an exclusive interview with the associated press “if he will feel some blood — smell that we are weak — he will push push push ” zelenskyy said in english which he used for virtually all of the interview the leader spoke to the ap aboard a train shuttling him across ukraine to cities near some of the fiercest fighting and others where his country’s forces have successfully repelled russia’s invasion zelenskyy rarely travels with journalists and the president’s office said ap’s twonight train trip with him was the most extensivesince the war began since then ukraine — backed by much of the west — has surprised the world with the strength of its resistance against the larger betterequipped russian military ukrainian forces haveheld their capital kyiv and pushed russia back from other strategically important areas but as the war enters its second year zelenskyy finds himself focused on keeping motivation high in both his military and the general ukrainian population — particularly the millions who have fled abroad and those living in relative comfort and security far from the front lines zelenskyy is also well aware that his country’s success has been in great part due to waves of international military support particularly from the united states and western europe but some in the united states — including republican donald trump the former american president and currentcandidate — have questioned whether washington should continue to supply ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid trump’s likely republican rival florida gov ron desantis also suggested that defending ukraine in a “territorial dispute” with russia was not a significant u s national security priority he laterwalked that statement back after facing criticism from other corners of the gop zelenskyy didn’t mention the names of trump or any other republican politicians — figures he might have to deal with if they prevailed inelections but he did say that he worries the war could be impacted by shifting political forces in washington “the united states really understands that if they stop helping us we will not win ” he said in the interview he sipped tea as he sat on a narrow bed in the cramped unadorned sleeper cabin on a state railway train the president’s carefully calibrated railroad trip was a remarkable journey across land through a country at war zelenskyy who has become a recognizable face across the world as he doggedly tells his side of the story to nation after nation used the moralebuilding journey to carry his considerable clout to regions close to the front lines he traveled with a small cadre of advisers and a large group of heavily armed security officials dressed in battlefield fatigues his destinations included ceremonies marking the oneyear anniversary of the liberation of towns in the sumy region and visits with troops stationed at frontline positions near zaporizhzhia each visit was kept under wraps until after he departed zelenskyy recently made a similar visitnear bakhmut where ukrainian and russian forces have been locked for months in a grinding and bloody battle while some western military analysts have suggested that the city is not of significant strategic importance zelenskyy warned that a loss anywhere at this stage in the war could put ukraine’s hardfought momentum at risk “we can’t lose the steps because the war is a pie — pieces of victories small victories small steps ” he said zelensky’s comments were an acknowledgement that losing the monthlong battle for bakhmut — the longest of the war thus far — would be more of a costly political defeat than a tactical one he predicted that the pressure from a defeat in bakhmut would come quickly — both from the international community and within his own country “our society will feel tired ” he said “our society will push me to have compromise with them ” so far zelenskyy says he hasn’t felt that pressure the international community has largely rallied around ukraine following russia’s feb   invasion in recent months a parade of world leaders have visited zelenskyy in ukraine most traveling in on trains similar to the ones the president uses to crisscross the country in his ap interview zelenskyy extended an invitation to ukraine to one notable and strategically important leader who has not made the journey — chinese president xi jinping “we are ready to see him here ” he said “i want to speak with him i had contact with him before fullscale war but during all this year more than one year i didn’t have ” china economically aligned and politically favorable toward russia across many decades has provided putin diplomatic cover by staking out an official position of neutrality in the war asked whether xi would accept an invitation from zelenskyy — or whether one had been officially extended — chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman mao ning told reporters she had no information to give she did say that beijing maintains “communication with all parties concerned including ukraine ” dbadbbaebbfdd kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov asked whether a meeting between xi and zelenskyy would be useful to resolve the conflict in ukraine said russian authorities “highly appreciate” china’s balanced position on the issue and “have no right to come up with any advice” on whether the two should meet “the chinese leader himself decides the appropriateness of certain contacts ” peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters wednesday xi visited putin in russia last week raising the prospect that beijing might be ready to provide moscow with the weapons and ammunition it needs to refill its depleted stockpile but xi’s trip ended without any such announcement days later putin announced that he would be deploying tactical nuclear weapons to belarus which neighbors russia and pushes the kremlin’s nuclear stockpile closer to nato territory zelenskyy suggested putin’s move was intended to distract from the lack of guarantees he received from china “what does it mean it means that the visit was not good for russia ” zelenskyy speculated he was unsparing in his assessment of putin calling him an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war “he doesn’t have allies ” zelenskyy said the ukrainian president makes few predictions about the biggest question hanging over the war how it will end he expressed confidence however that his nation will prevail through a series of “small victories” and “small steps” against a “very big country big enemy big army” — but an army he said with “small hearts ” and ukraine itself while zelenskyy acknowledged that the war has “changed us ” he said that in the end it has made his society stronger “it could’ve gone one way to divide the country or another way — to unite us ” he said “i’m so thankful i’m thankful to everybody — every single partner our people thank god everybody — that we found this way in this critical moment for the nation finding this way was the thing that saved our nation and we saved our land we are together ”
